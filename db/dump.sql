The mammoth balloons were being unwrapped and we immediately whipped out our cameras to record this unusual sight. We met our pilot, who then got busy lighting what looked like a flame-thrower and the fire began to heat up the air inside the balloon. The fabric swelled out majestically, the balloon became upright and our air chariot was ready for us.\r\n\r\nWe were helped into the basket – I believe it’s called a gondola – and made ourselves comfortable. Then, it seemed as if someone released the invisible ropes that tie us to mother earth, we swayed a little, there was a sudden flare of flames above us… and we were up, up and away.\r\n\r\nWe were lifted gently, watching the earth fall away below us. Soon, we were flying over forts and castles, craggy mountains, sandy stretches and green plains. We dipped down to kiss the waters of a limpid lake, then floated up again. We flew over towns and villages, even spotted a herd of deer. None of us had ever seen the world from this perspective. There’s no rush, no urgency, no whirring of engines.

However, Agra’s attractions are much more than can be seen in a day, and if you have the time you can enjoy several days’ sightseeing with side trips to Fatehpur Sikri and Mathura.','In 1501, Sultan Sikander Lodi established his capital here, but the city fell into Mughal hands in 1526, when Emperor Babur defeated the last Lodi sultan at Panipat, 80km north of Delhi. Agra reached the peak of its magnificence between the mid-16th and mid-17th centuries during the reigns of Akbar, Jehangir and Shah Jahan. During this period the fort, the Taj Mahal and other major mausoleums were built. In 1638 Shah Jahan built a new city in Delhi, and his son Aurangzeb moved the capital there 10 years later. In 1761 Agra fell to the Jats, a warrior class who looted its monuments, including the Taj Mahal. The Marathas took over in 1770, but were replaced by the British in 1803. Following the Uprising of 1857, the British shifted the administration of the province to Allahabad. Deprived of its administrative role, Agra developed as a centre for heavy industry, quickly becoming famous for its chemicals industry and atmospheric pollution, before the Taj and tourism became a major source of income.','agra',1,1,'2013-07-07 15:31:59','2013-07-08 21:53:11','agra_fort_india-normal.jpg','taj-nature-walk10.jpg','taj_mahal-in-morning.jpg','The-Courtyard-of-Sikandra.jpg'),(3,'Jhansi',2,284001,285251,'https://maps.google.co.in/maps?q=Jhansi&hl=en&sll=25.456959,78.576731&sspn=0.079047,0.169086&hnear=Jhansi,+Uttar+Pradesh&t=m&z=11','Jhansi is a historic city of northern India, located on the banks of the Pahuj or Pushpavati River, in the state of Uttar Pradesh.

Jhansi is well connected to all other major towns in Uttar Pradesh by road and railway networks. It is about 415 km from New Delhi and 292 km from Lucknow, and is called the Gateway to Bundelkhand. The National Highway Development Project has supported development of Jhansi. The north-south corridor connecting Kashmir to Kanyakumari passes through Jhansi as does the East-West corridor; consequently there has been a sudden rush to infrastructure and real estate development in the city. A greenfield airport development has been planned.','Jhansi was a stronghold of the Chandela kings. Balwant Nagar was the name of this place. But in 11th century Jhansi lost its importance.

Raja Bir Singh Deo got constructed the Jhansi fort and around it got established a BALWANT NAGAR which later on named jhansi.In 1817 the Maratha Peshwa in Pune had ceded all his rights over Bundelkhand to the Company. After the death of Shiv Rao his grandson Ramchandra Rao was made subedar of Jhansi. He was not a good administrator. Ramchandra Rao died in 1835. The financial position of Jhansi was very critical. However the raja was a cultured man who was able to enrich the architecture of the city and acquire a fine library of Sanskrit manuscripts, though he was without issue. Raja Ganghadar Rao adopted a child called Anand Rao, the son of his cousin, who was renamed Damodar Rao, on the day before he died. The adoption was in the presence of the British political officer who was given a letter from the raja requesting that the child should be treated with kindness and that the government of Jhansi should be given to his widow for her lifetime. After the death of the raja in November 1853 because Damodar Rao was adopted, the British East India Company, under Governor-General Lord Dalhousie, applied the Doctrine of Lapse, rejecting Damodar Rao\'s claim.

These archaeological remains suggest that the Varanasi area was populated by Vedic people. However, the Atharvaveda (the oldest known text referencing the city), which dates to approximately the same period, suggests that the area was populated by indigenous tribes.

Lucknow is accessible from every part of India through air, rail and road.','Many independent kingdoms, such as Awadh, were established when the Mughal empire disintegrated. The third Nawab, Shuja-ud-Daula, fell out with the British after aiding the fugitive Nawab of Bengal Mir Qasim. He was comprehensively defeated in the Battle of Buxar by the East India Company, which forced him to pay heavy penalties and cede parts of his territory. Awadh’s capital, Lucknow rose to prominence when Asaf-ud-Daula, the fourth nawab, shifted his court here from Faizabad in 1775. The British appointed a resident in 1773 and over time gained control of more territory and authority in the state. They were, however, disinclined to capture Awadh outright and be brought face to face with the Marathas and the remnants of the Mughal Empire. In 1798, the fifth Nawab Wazir Ali Khan alienated both his people and the British, and was forced to abdicate. The British then helped Saadat Ali Khan to the throne. Saadat Ali Khan was a puppet king, who in the treaty of 1801 ceded half of Awadh to the British East India Company and also agreed to disband his troops in favour of a hugely expensive, British-run army. This treaty effectively made the state of Awadh a vassal to the British East India Company, though it nationally continued to be part of the Mughal Empire in name until 1819. The treaty of 1801 formed an arrangement that was very beneficial to the Company. They were able to use Awadh\'s vast treasuries, repeatedly digging into them for loans at reduced rates. In addition, the revenues from running Awadh\'s armed forces brought them useful revenues while it acted as a buffer state. The Nawabs were ceremonial kings, busy with pomp and show but with little influence over matters of state. By the mid-nineteenth century, however, the British had grown impatient with the arrangement and wanted direct control of Awadh.','lucknow',1,1,'2013-07-07 15:51:23','2013-07-08 21:37:46','La_Martini_re_College__Lucknow_-_1880_s.jpg','Bada-Imbarra-Lucknow.jpg','India_Lucknow_Hotel.jpg','Lucknow.jpg'),(10,'Udaipur',1,307025,313906,'<iframe width=\"425\" height=\"350\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"https://maps.google.co.in/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Udaipur,+Rajasthan&amp;aq=0&amp;oq=Uda,+Rajasthan&amp;sll=26.238947,73.024','Udaipur is often called ‘Venice of the East’.

The invasion of Delhi by Timur in 1398 put an end to the sultanate; the Lodis, last of the Delhi sultans, gave way to Babur, who, after the battle of Panipat in 1526, founded the Mughal Empire. The early Mughal emperors privileged Agra as their capital, and Delhi became their permanent seat only after Shah Jahan built (1638) the walls of Old Delhi.\r\n','delhi',1,1,'2013-07-07 19:38:52','2013-07-08 22:56:44','delhi1.jpg','india_gate_new_delhi.jpg','india-scenery-352-2.jpg','red.jpg'),(16,'Bangalore',3,560001,560104,'https://maps.google.co.in/maps?q=Bangalore&hl=en&sll=15.261414,74.613136&sspn=0.08446,0.169086&hnear=Bangalore,+Bangalore+Urban,+Karnataka&t=m&z=10','Bangalore: The Garden City Bangalore. When one thinks of this place about 50 years ago, tranquil images of a clean, green, and beautiful city conjure up. The definition of a perfect pensioner\'s paradise. Every other city\'s envy. A fast growing metropolis, the garden city of Bangalore is the capital of the southern Indian state of Karnataka. Situated at about 1000 meters above sea level, it is known for its salubrious climate where temperatures remain moderate through out the year. The maximum temperature in July is around 320C and the minimum around 220C. It is connected by air, rail and road to all major cities of the country and has direct international connections to many cities worldwide. ','The region of modern day Bangalore was part of several successive South Indian kingdoms. After centuries of the rule of the Western Gangas, the region was captured by the Cholas in 1024. In 1116 the Hoysala Empire overthrew the Cholas and extended its rule over the region. Modern Bangalore had its beginning in 1537 by a vassal of the Vijayanagara Empire, Kempé Gowda I, who built a mud-brick fort at the site that would become the central part of modern Bangalore. Kempé Gowda referred to the new town as his \"gandubhūmi\" or \"Land of Heroes\". Within the fort, the town was divided into smaller divisions—each called a \"pete\". The town had two main streets—Chikkapeté Street, which ran east-west, and Doddapeté Street, which ran north-south. Their intersection formed the Doddapeté Square—the heart of Bangalore. Kempé Gowda\'s successor, Kempé Gowda II, built four towers that marked Bangalore\'s boundary. During the Vijayanagara rule, many Saints and Poets referred to Bangalore as \"Devarāyanagara\" and \"Kalyānapura\" or \"Kalyānapuri\" (\"Auspicious City\").

Amazingly, ruminants of this culture remain huddled along the city shoreline today. A succession of Hindu dynasties held sway over the islands from the 6th century AD until the Muslim Sultans of Gujarat annexed the area in the 14th century, eventually ceding it to Portugal in 1534. The only memorable contribution the Portuguese made to the area was christening it Bom Bahai, before throwing the islands in with the dowry of Catherine of Braganza when she married England’s Charles II in 1661. The British government took possession of the islands in 1665, but leased them three years later to the East India Company for the paltry annual rent of UK£10. Then called Bombay, the area flourished as a trading port. So much so that within 20 years the presidency of the East India Company was transferred to Bombay from Surat. Bombay’s fort was completed in the 1720s, and a century later ambitious land reclamation projects joined the islands into today’s single landmass. Although Bombay grew steadily during the 18th century, it remained isolated from its hinterland until the British defeated the Marathas (the central Indian people who controlled much of India at various times) and annexed substantial portions of western India.

The Indus valley civilization, known to be one of the ancient civilised societies, developed in this area also and several sites belonging to this civilisation are discovered in Kutch. However, now most of the river lies in Pakistan after British India was partitioned. Kutch was formerly an independent kingdom, founded in the late 13th century by a Samma Rajput branch called Jadeja Rajputs. The Jadeja dynasty ruled not only Kutch but also much of neighboring Kathiawar for several centuries until the independence of India in 1947. In 1815 Kutch became a British protectorate and ultimately a Princely State of Cutch, whose local ruler acknowledged British sovereignty in return for local autonomy. Bhuj was the Capital of Princely State of Kutch. One surviving relic of the princely era is the beautiful Aina Mahal (\"mirror palace\"), built in the 1760s at Bhuj for the Maharao of Kutch by Ram Singh Malam who had learnt glass, enamel and tile work from the Dutch. Along with that during that time period Kutch had its own currency, while the rest of British India was using rupees.

Back at the base of the mountain, however, deep in the heart of the oldest quarter of the city, you can walk down into the depths of the earth in a pair of ancient stepwells that were not built, but hewn out of solid rock.

','Junagadh remained important as a regional capital until the 5th century. Then under the Rajputs and Solankis it was less important, as power centers shifted to near Bhavnagar (until the 10th century), later to Patan (until the 15th century), where it stayed when the whole of Gujarat became a province of the Delhi Sultanate, and then to Ahmedabad when Gujarat again became an independent Sultanate.  The Mughals took over in the early 16th century, and continued to rule from Ahmedabad, so it was not until the mid 18th century as Mughal rule was in decline that Junagadh once again became an independent princely state, established by an Afghan named Sher Khan Babi, with its capital here.','junagadh',1,1,'2013-07-08 21:27:16','2013-07-08 21:27:16','junagadh_fort.jpg','12_full.jpg','167063387_967e945793_o.jpg','DSC03010.JPG'),(22,'Vadodara',8,391421,391165,'https://maps.google.co.in/maps?q=Vadodara&hl=en&sll=23.733733,69.859741&sspn=2.564379,5.410767&hnear=Vadodara,+Gujarat&t=m&z=11','If you seek the stillness of earth before the human empire, then imagine prehistoric times when the humans here on the banks of the river Vishwamitri, were outnumbered by vad, or banyan trees, from which the place derived its name.

In this context, it is worth mentioning that the deity of the Katalayi Sreekrishna temple was originally installed in a shrine at Katalayi Kotta in the south eastern part of the present Kannur town.','The earliest evidence of human habitation in the district are rock-cut caves and megalithic burial sites of the Neolithic age. The Taliparamba-Kannur-Thalassery area abounds in rock-cut caves, dolmens, burial stone circles and menhirs, all of megalithic burial order[citation needed]. The district was part of the Chera kingdom, which ruled most of Kerala during the first several centuries CE. Later Kannur was the capital of the Kolattiri Rajas, whose kingdom had trading relations with Arabia and Persia in the 12th century and 13th centuries. In his book on travels (Il Million), Marco Polo recounts his visit to the area in mid 1290s. Other visitors included Faxian, the Buddhist pilgrim and Ibn Batuta, writer and historian of Tangiers.','kannur',1,1,'2013-07-09 08:13:47','2013-07-10 09:32:57','1348639261_16053.jpg','hampi-photos1.jpg','Kannur-kotta-kannur-fort.jpg','lakkidi.jpg'),(29,'Kasaragod',14,670511,671552,'https://maps.google.co.in/maps?q=Kasaragod,+Kerala&hl=en&sll=11.874478,75.370366&sspn=0.095249,0.169086&oq=Kasaragod,+Kerala&hnear=Kasaragod,+Kerala&t=m&z=13','There are different views on the derivation of the name \"KASARAGOD\".

Throughout thousands of years of great civilisations, invasions, the birth of religions and countless cataclysms, India has time and again proved itself to be, in the words of its first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, ‘a bundle of contradictions held together by strong but invisible threads’. Indian history has always been a work-in-progress, a constant process of reinvention and accumulation that can prove elusive for those seeking to grasp its essential essence. And yet, from its myriad upheavals, a vibrant, diverse and thoroughly modern nation has emerged, as enduring as it is dynamic and increasingly well equipped to meet the challenges of the future.\r\n','india',1,1,'307870932_b0a207a66d_b.jpg','Gadi_Sagar_Temple_Jaisalmer_Rajasthan_India_1440x1080.jpg','Gate-way-of-India.jpg','photo-of-varanasi-uttar-pradesh-india-cultural-tourism-107974.jpg','2013-07-08 05:02:51','2013-07-08 05:02:51');

Located in the heart of Jaipur, this beautiful five-storey palace was constructed in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh who belonged to Kachhwaha Rajput dynasty. The main architect of this palace built of red and pink sandstone, is Lal Chand Ustad and the palace is believed to have been constructed in the form of the crown of Krishna, the Hindu god. Considered as an embodiment of Rajputana architecture, the main highlight of Hawa Mahal is its pyramid shape and its 953 windows or \'Jharokhas\' which are decorated with intricate designs. The main intention behind the construction of the Mahal was to facilitate the royal women and provide them a view of everyday life through the windows, as they never appeared in public.

Sawai Pratap Singh\'s devotion to Lord Krishna is evident in the palace\'s construction as it resembles the lord\'s crown. Though many reasons are cited behind the construction of the fort, Purdah system followed by the Rajputs is said to be one of the main causes. During those days, Rajput royal women did not appear in public or in front of strangers. However, they were keen to follow the day-to-day events and royal processions occurring on the streets. It is for their benefit that the Hawa Mahal was built, complete with small windows and screened balconies. This gave the women a sense of freedom, without appearing in public.','hawa-mahal',0,1,'634924054127102313_Hawa_Mahal__Jaipur__Rajasthan3.jpg','hawa-mahal.jpg','Hawamahal-08.jpg','Hawa-Mahal2.jpg','2013-07-07 14:11:38','2013-07-09 20:52:24'),(2,'Fatehpur Sikri',2,'https://maps.google.co.in/maps?q=Sikandra&hl=en&ll=27.178053,78.01471&spn=0.009735,0.021136&sll=27.179456,78.021341&sspn=0.009735,0.021136&hq=Sikandra&t=m&z=16','This magnificent fortified ghost city, 40km west of Agra, was the short-lived capital of the Mughal empire between 1571 and 1585, during the reign of Emperor Akbar. Akbar visited Sikri to consult the Sufi saint Shaikh Salim Chisti, who predicted the birth of an heir to the Mughal throne. When the prophecy came true, Akbar built his new capital here. Although a brilliant Indo-Islamic masterpiece, the city was erected in an area that suffered from water shortages and was abandoned shortly after Akbar’s death.

This ancient city bears many fine architectural monuments which bear testimony to a blend of Indian, Persian and Mughal architectural influences. The history of the origin of this city is quite interesting. Akbar had visited a saint known as Salim Chishti who then foretold that the emperor would have a second son who will survive to become a great ruler. The Sufi saint was then residing in a cavern near a ridge at Sikri. When in 1569 a second son was indeed born to Akbar, he decided to move his capital from Agra to Sikri in honor of the saint Salim. The son was also known as Prince Salim, who later grew up to become the great emperor Jehangir. The Mughal emperor then started the construction of an architectural wonder of a town, based on the influences of the Persian architecture which he had witnessed during the rule of his ancestor, Timur.

The construction of the Taj Mahal was entrusted to a board of architects under imperial supervision, including Abd ul-Karim Ma\'mur Khan, Makramat Khan, and Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.

Construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632. The court chronicles of Shah Jahan\'s grief illustrate the love story traditionally held as an inspiration for Taj Mahal. The principal mausoleum was completed in 1648 and the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later. Emperor Shah Jahan himself described the Taj in these words.','Soon after the Taj Mahal\'s completion, Shah Jahan was deposed by his son Aurangzeb and put under house arrest at nearby Agra Fort.

When Emperor Shah Jahan paraded out of the fort atop an elephant into the streets of Old Delhi, though, he and the fort that he built were a grandiose display of pomp and power. The walls of the fort extend for 2km and vary in height from 18m on the river side to 33m on the city side. Shah Jahan began construction of the massive fort in 1638 and it was completed in 1648. Shah Jahan never completely moved his capital from Agra to his new city of Shahjahanabad in Delhi because he was deposed and imprisoned in Agra Fort by his sly son Aurangzeb. The Red Fort dates from the very peak of Mughal power. The Mughal reign from Delhi was a short one, however; Aurangzeb was the first and last great Mughal emperor to rule from here. The 10m-deep moat, which has been bone-dry since 1857, was originally crossed on creaky wooden drawbridges, but these were replaced with stone bridges in 1811. Tickets to the fort are available from the ticket kiosk opposite Lahore Gate (the main gate). Since Independence, many landmark political speeches have taken place at the fort and every year on Independence Day (15 August) it hosts the prime minister\'s address to the nation. Each evening (except Monday) a one-hour sound-and-light show re-creates events of India\'s history, particularly those associated with the Red Fort.','The Red Fort derives its name from the extensive use of red sandstone on the massive walls that surround the fort. Shah Jahan commissioned the construction of the Red Fort in 1638 when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Ustad Ahmad and Ustad Hamid were chosen as the architects for construction of the royal palace. Construction began in the auspicious month of Muharram on 13 May 1638. Construction of the fort was supervised by Shah Jahan himself and was completed in 1648. The Red Fort was originally referred to as \"Qila-i-Mubarak\" (the blessed fort), because it was the residence of the royal family. Unlike the other Mughal forts, layout of the boundary walls of the Red Fort is not symmetrical so as to retain and integrate the older Salimgarh Fort. The fortress palace was an important focal point of the medieval city of Shahjahanabad (present day Old Delhi). The planning and aesthetics of the Red Fort represent the zenith of Mughal creativity which prevailed during the reign of emperor Shah Jahan. Aurangzeb, Shah Jahan\'s successor, added the Moti Masjid to the emperor\'s private quarters and constructed barbicans in front of the two main gates, which made the entrance route to the palace more circuitous.','red-fort-lal-qila',0,1,'Red__Fort.jpg','RedFort_001.jpg','Red-Fort-Delhi-Picture-3.jpg','red-fort-new-delhi.jpg','2013-07-07 19:42:19','2013-07-09 20:52:25'),(18,'Gurdwara Bangla Sahib',15,'https://maps.google.co.in/maps?q=Gurdwara+Bangla+Sahib&hl=en&ll=28.626419,77.208996&spn=0.076846,0.169086&sll=28.631993,77.206249&sspn=0.076842,0.169086&hq=Gurdwara+Bangla+Sahib&radius=15000&t=m&z=13','The Gurdwara Bangla Sahib is an important Sikh shrine and a constant hive of TActivity.

The mosque was the result of the efforts of over 6,000 workers, over a period of six years (1650–1656 AD). The cost of the construction in those times was 10 lakh (1 million) Rupees. Emperor Shahjahan also built the Taj Mahal, at Agra and the Red Fort in New Delhi, which stands opposite the Jama Masjid. The Jama Masjid was completed in 1656 AD (1066 AH), with three great gates, four towers and two 40 m-high minarets constructed of strips of red sandstone and white marble. About 25,000 people can pray here at a time. The mosque has a vast paved rectangular courtyard, which is nearly 75 m by 66 m.

Maharawal Beri Sal commissioned the construction of this Haveli. The architects of this haveli were Hathi and Lulu who happened to be brothers. There is a very interesting story regarding its construction. It is said that the two brothers started building different facets of haveli simultaneously. In those days there were no such instruments, which could keep a track on continuity and thus when this building came up finally it had irregular shape. Barring that, this haveli is still considered the best in Jaisalmer in terms of grandeur. There are other minute details worth appreciation. For example there are two Elephants made of yellow stone. These life-size replicas have been put in front of the main entrance so that it looks as if they are guarding the Haveli. Other than these, there are pictures engraved on pillars and walls. These consist of Horses, Cattle, and depiction of Flora among other things. But the most interesting aspect of this haveli is the drawing of modern amenities such as cars, fans etc. It is said and believed that the Architect brothers dint see these things ever in their life and engraved it with mere help of their descriptions given by people who had seen it. Thus the architecture present in this haveli is quite different from the one popular in other parts of Jaisalmer. The workmanship of Jaisalmer havelis is an amalgam of both Rajput architecture as well as Islamic art that was imported via the traders\' caravan through the desert.','This is probably the last of the big family haveli to be so decorated. It was constructed in the mid of 19th century, but it is in many ways the most beautiful examples of the subtly of the stone carver’s art. There is delicacy in the finish of the work which at times, as around the tiny little arched windows become pure magic. Nothing at Fatehpur Sikri and not even the famous white marble pierced screen in the Taj can compare in lightness with the exquisite work here. One feels one could pick it up and crush it like a handful of cake.\r\nThe remarkable fact about Nathmal is that it was carved by two brothers Hati and Laloo (The Silawats or stone carvers were all muslims and these families migrated to Pakistan in 1947). They were famous carvers in Jaisalmer State. Each undertook to work on one entire side i.e. the left side by one and right by the other.

There is a plaque fixed on one of the structures in the Jantar Mantar observatory in New Delhi that was placed there in 1910 mistakenly dating the construction of the complex to the year 1710. Later research, though, suggests 1724 as the actual year of construction. The primary purpose of the observatory was to compile astronomical tables, and to predict the times and movements of the sun, moon and planets.

It has a 128-foot-long (39 m) hypotenuse that is parallel to the Earth\'s axis and points toward the North Pole. On either side of the triangle is a quadrant with graduations indicating hours, minutes, and seconds. At the time of the Samrat Yantra\'s construction, sundials already existed, but the Samrat Yantra turned the basic sundial into a precision tool for measuring declination and other related coordinates of various heavenly bodies. Jayaprakash Yantra: The Jayaprakash consists of hollowed out hemispheres with markings on their concave surfaces. Crosswires were stretched between points on their rim. From inside the Ram, an observer could align the position of a star with various markings or a window\'s edge.

The architect, Mirak Mirza Ghiyuath, was Persian and had previously designed buildings in Herat (now northwest Afghanistan), Bukhara (now Uzbekistan), and elsewhere in India. The location chosen for the building on the bank of the Yamuna river adjoins the shrine of an important Sufi Chistiyya order saint, Nizam al-Din Awliya. The Chistiyya was particularly venerated by the Mughals; Humayun\'s son, Akbar, would build his new palace at Fatehpur Sikri next to the shrine of another saint of the Chistiyya order. The tomb established some of the important norms for later Mughal mausolea. It is set in a geometrically arranged garden criscrossed by numerous water channels and probably representing symbolically a paradise setting. Such typical Persian gardens had been introduced into India by Babur; later they would be found in the Red Fort in Delhi and at the Taj Mahal in Agra.

It is also called the \"Lake Garden Palace\". The palace is located in Udaipur city in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Its construction is credited to three Maharanas of the Sisodia Rajputs of Mewar kingdom. The construction of the palace was started in 1551 by Maharana Amar Singh, continued by Maharana Karan Singh (1620–1628) and finally completed by Maharana Jagat Singh I (1628–1652). It is named as \"Jagat Mandir\" in honour of the last named Maharana Jagat Singh. The royal family used the palace as a summer resort and pleasure palace for holding parties. The palace served as a refuge to asylum seekers on two separate occasions.','Jag Mandir\'s history begins with the Maharana Karan Singh\'s benevolence shown to Emperor Shahjahan (1605–1627). Shahjahan, before he was crowned as Mughal Emperor, was known during his young days as Prince Khurram. As Khurram, he rebelled against his father Emperor Jahangir in 1623, because he wanted to be the heir to the Mughal throne. Faced with danger of getting thwarted in his campaign, he sought refuge in Mewar Kingdom at Udaipur where he was given safe haven by the then Maharana Karan Singh (it is said that this courtesy was extended because Khurram\'s mother was a Rajput Hindu lady). He was initially kept in the City Palace along with his wife Mumtaz Mahal and his two sons, Prince Dara and Prince Aurangzeb. Later they were shifted to the Gul Mahal, as a safe refuge, in the midst of the lake (this place since then has also been called Khurram\'s Palace). Gul Mahal is a domed pavilion that was specially built for Khurram by Maharana Karan Singh. It was later enlarged by his son Jagat Singh into a huge palace and named as the Jag Mandir palace. Khurram remained under Mewar\'s protection during 1623–1624.','jag-mandir',0,1,'8_Jag_Mandir_at_night.jpg','Jag_Mandir.jpg','jag-mandir__1_.jpg','Wedding_at_Jag_Mandir_Palace.jpg','2013-07-07 20:25:34','2013-07-09 20:13:58'),(53,'Monsoon Palace',10,'https://maps.google.co.in/maps?q=Monsoon+Palace,+Udaipur,+Rajasthan&hl=en&sll=24.56756,73.678023&sspn=0.009953,0.021136&oq=Monsoon+Palace&hq=Monsoon+Palace,+Udaipur,+Rajasthan&t=m&z=16','The Monsoon Palace, formerly known as the Sajjan Garh Palace, is a hilltop palatial residence in the city of Udaipur, Rajasthan in India, overlooking the lake Pichola.

Udaipur was the historic capital of the former kingdom of Mewar in the Rajputana Agency and its last capital. \r\n The City Palace in Udaipur was built in a flamboyant style and is considered the largest of its type in Rajasthan, a fusion of the Rajasthani and Mughal architectural styles, and was built on a hill top that gives a panoramic view of the city and its surrounding, including several historic monuments such as the Lake Palace in Lake Pichola, the Jag Mandir on another island in the lake, the Jagdish Temple close to the palace, theMonsoon Palace on top of an overlooking hillock nearby and the Neemach Mata temple.

In the 8th century, the capital was moved to Chittor, a hill top fort from where the Sisodias ruled for 80 years. Maharana Udai Singh II inherited the Mewar kingdom at Chittor in 1537 but by that time there were signs of losing control of the fort in wars with the Mughals. Udai Singh II, therefore, chose the site near Lake Pichola for his new kingdom because the location was well protected on all sides by forests, lakes and the Aravalli hills. He had chosen this site for his new capital, much before the sacking of Chittor by Emperor Akbar, on the advice of a hermit he had met during one of his hunting expeditions.\r\nRoyal Angan the first structure built by Maharana Udai Singh\r\nAt his capital Chittor, Maharana Udai Singh soon faced defeat at the hands of Mughal Emperor Akbar. He soon moved to Udaipur to the chosen location to establish his new capital.

The fort precinct with an evocative history is studded with a series of historical palaces, gates, temples and two prominent commemoration towers. These monumental ruins have inspired the imagination of tourists and writers for centuries.

Each time the men fought bravely rushing out of the fort walls charging the enemy but lost every time. Following these defeats, Jauhar was committed thrice by more than 13,000 ladies and children of the Rajput heroes who laid their lives in battles at Chittorgarh Fort, first led by Rani Padmini wife of Rana Rattan Singh who was killed in the battle in 1303, and later by Rani Karnavati in 1537 AD. Thus, the fort represents the quintessence of tribute to the nationalism, courage, medieval chivalry and sacrifice exhibited by the Mewar rulers of Sisodia and their kinsmen and women and children, between the 7th and 16th centuries. The rulers, their soldiers, the women folk of royalty and the commoners considered death as a better option than dishonor in the face of surrender to the foreign invading armies.','Chittorgarh Fort is considered to be the largest fort of India in terms of area.

Historical records show Chittorgarh fort as the capital of Mewar for 834 years.It was established in 734 AD by Bappa Rawal, founder ruler in the hierarchy of the Sisodia rulers of Mewar. It is also said that the fort was gifted to Bappa Rawal as part of Solanki princess’s dowry in the 8th century.The fort was looted and destroyed at the hands of Emperor Akbar in 1568 AD and subsequently never resettled but only refurbished in 1905 AD. Three important battles were fought for control of the fort; in 1303, Ala-ud-din Khilji besieged the fort; in 1535, Sultan of Gujarat Bahadur Shah besieged the fort; and in 1568, Mughal Emperor Akbar attacked the fort.Not that there were only defeats at the fort. Excluding the periods of siege, the fort had always remained in possession of the Sisodias of the Guhilot (or Gehlot/Guhila) clan of Rajputs, who descended from Bappa Rawal.

This style of palace became the forerunner of other palaces built in the state with the concept of Jal Mahal (palace surrounded by water). It is at this Palace where Alauddin was permitted to glimpse at the mirror image of Rani Padmini, wife of Maharana Rattan Singh. It is widely believed that this glimpse of Padmini\'s beauty besotted him and convinced him to destroy Chittor in order to possess her. Maharana Rattan Singh was killed and Rani Padmini committed Jauhar. Rani Padmini\'s beauty is compared to that of Cleopatra and her life story is an eternal legend in the history of Chittor, in particular and of the Mewar state in general. The bronze gates to this pavilion were removed and transported to Agra by Akbar.','In 1303 Allauddin khilji, Sultan of Delhi, intrigued by tales of the matchless beauty of Padmini, Rani of Chittor, of her wit and charm, decided to verify this himself. His armies surrounded Chittor, and the sultan sent a message to Rana Rattan Singh, Padmini\'s husband, to say that he would spare the city if he could meet its famous queen. The compromise finally reached was that the sultan could look upon Padmini\'s reflection if he came unarmed into the fort. Accordingly, the sultan went up the hill and glimpsed a reflection of the beautiful Padmini standing by a lotus pool. He thanked his host who courteously escorted Allauddin down to the outer gate-where the sultan\'s men waited in ambush to take the rana hostage.There was consternation in Chittor until Padmini devised a plan. A messenger informed the sultan that the rani would come to him. Dozens of curtained palanquins set off down the hill, each carried by six humble bearers. Once inside the Sultan\'s camp, four well-armed Rajput warriors leaped out of each palanquin and each lowly palanquin bearer drew a sword.In the ensuing battle, Rana Rattan Singh was rescued-but 7,000 Rajput warriors died. The sultan now attacked Chittor with renewed vigor. Having lost 7,000 of its best warriors, Chittor could not hold out. Surrender was unthinkable. The rani and her entire entourage of women, the wives of generals and soldiers, sent their children into hiding with loyal retainers. They then dressed their wedding fine , slid their farewells, and singing ancient hymns, boldly entered the mahal and performed jauhar.','padmini-palace',0,1,'634923916862773221_Padmini_Palace__Chittorgarh__Rajasthan.jpg','Oil_painting_of_Padmini_s_palace_in_the_fort_in_the_midst_of_the_tank.jpg','DSCN3843.JPG','DSCF1448.JPG','2013-07-07 21:01:59','2013-07-09 21:55:50'),(82,'Dargah Of Khwaja Muin-Ud-Din Chishti',12,'<iframe width=\"425\" height=\"350\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"https://maps.google.co.in/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Dargah+Of+Khwaja+Moinuddin+Chishti,+Rajasthan&amp;aq=&amp;sll=24.879346,74','Moinuddin Chishti Also known as Gharib Nawaz \"Benefactor of the Poor\"  he is the most famous Sufi saint of the Chishti Order of the Indian Subcontinent.

The fort was originally called Chintamani and was renamed Junagarh or \"Old Fort\" in the early 20th century when the ruling family moved to Lalgarh Palace outside the fort limits. It is one of the few major forts in Rajasthan which is not built on a hilltop. The modern city of Bikaner has developed around the fort.The fort complex was built under the supervision of Karan Chand, the Prime Minister of Raja Rai Singh, the sixth ruler of Bikaner, who ruled from 1571 to 1611 AD. Construction of the walls and associated moat commenced in 1589 and was completed in 1594. It was built outside the original fort of the city, about 1.5 km from the city centre. Some remnants of the old fort are preserved near the Lakshmi Narayan temple.Historical records reveal that despite the repeated attacks by enemies to capture the fort, it was not taken, except for a lone one-day occupation by Kamran Mirza. Kamran was the second son of the Mughal Emperor Babur who attacked Bikaner in 1534, which was then ruled by Rao Jait Singh. In the battle, the Mughals were defeated by Rathors. Kamran then returned to Lahore.The 5.28 hectares large fort precinct is studded with palaces, temples and pavilions.These buildings depict a composite culture, manifest in the mix of architectural styles.','Before the present Junagarh Fort was built, an old stone fort existed in the city. This fort was built in 1478 by Rao Bika who established the city of Bikaner in 1472. Rao Bika was the second son of Maharaja Rao Jodha of the Rathor clan, the founder of Jodhpur city. He conquered the large arid lands to the northern region of Rajasthan to set up his domain. As the second son of Jodha he had no chance of inheriting his father’s territory of Jodhpur or to the title of Maharaja. He, therefore, reconciled and decided to build his own kingdom at Bikaner at the place then called \"Jungladesh\". Bikaner, though a partly of the Thar Desert, was considered an oasis on the trade route between Central Asia and the Gujarat coast since it had adequate spring water sources. Bika’s name was thus tagged to the Bikaner city as well as to the then state of Bikaner (“the settlement of Bika”) that he established. The history of Bikaner and the fort within it thus start with Bika.It was only about 100 years later that Bikaner’s fortunes flourished under Raja Rai Singhji, the sixth ruler of Bikaner, who ruled from 1571 to 1611. During the Mughal Empire’s rule in the country, he accepted the suzerainty of the Mughals and held a high position of an army general in the court of Emperor Akbar and his son Emperor Jahangir. His successful war exploits by way of winning half of Mewar kingdom won him accolades and rewards from the Mughal emperors. He was gifted the jagirs (lands) of Gujarat and Burhanpur. With the large revenue earned from these jagirs, he built the Junagarh fort on a plain land, which has an average elevation of 760 feet. The formal foundation ceremony for the fort was held on 17 February 1589 and the fort was completed on 17 January 1594.Raja Rai Singhji, was an expert in arts and architecture and the knowledge that he acquired during his several sojourns to several countries are amply reflected in the numerous monuments he built in the Junagarh fort.Thus the fort, a composite structure, became an outstanding example of architecture and a unique centre of art, amidst the Thar desert.','junagarh-fort',0,1,'6849585964_6ae59c2b61_h.jpg','Junagarh_Fort_Bikaner.jpg','junagarh-fort-4.jpg','bikaner.jpg','2013-07-07 23:00:35','2013-07-09 20:52:27'),(95,'Jain Temples',14,'https://maps.google.co.in/maps?q=jain+temples+near+Bikaner,+Rajasthan&hl=en&sll=27.084499,75.715184&sspn=0.623568,1.352692&oq=Jain+Temples+bik&hq=jain+temples&hnear=Bikaner,+Rajasthan&t=m&z=15','This temple is oldest existing structure in Bikaner.

The mighty, myth-laden Ganges – Hinduism’s most sacred river – rises in Uttarakhand and flows through the state providing a spiritual backbone exemplified by the bathing ghats of Varanasi and the pilgrimage centre of Allahabad – the most auspicious of India’s four Kumbh Mela sites. Just outside Varanasi, Sarnath was where Buddha first preached his gospel of the middle way, and Kushinagar, near Gorakhpur, is where he died. Devotees of a different kind are drawn to Mathura and Vrindavan, the birthplace of the much-loved god Krishna. But nothing draws tourists like India’s most famous icon, the Taj Mahal, and the other Mughal monuments in Agra and Fatehpur Sikri.

Of course, the nawabs in UP’s capital Lucknow and the British in Allahabad also left behind an impressive architectural legacy that‘s lasted well beyond their downfall.

Muslim raids from the northwest began in the 11th century, and by the 16th century the region was part of the Mughal empire with its capital in Fatehpur Sikri, Agra and then Delhi. Following the decline of the Mughal empire, Persian invaders stepped in briefly before the nawabs of Avadh rose to prominence in the central part of the region. The nawabs were responsible for turning Lucknow into a flourishing centre for the arts, but their empire came to a dramatic end when the British East India Company deposed the last nawab, triggering the Uprising of 1857. Agra was later merged with Avadh and the state became known as United Province. It was renamed Uttar Pradesh after Independence and has since been the most dominant state in Indian politics, producing half of the country’s prime ministers. However, the people of the state have not benefited much from this as poor governance, a high birth rate, a low literacy rate and an erratic electricity supply have held back economic progress in the past 60 years.

The magnificent scenic beauty and the architectural splendours of its temples, churches and old houses have made Goa a firm favorite with travelers around the world. But then, Goa is much more than just beaches and sea. It has a soul which goes deep into unique history, rich culture and some of the prettiest natural scenery that India has to offer. Much of the real Goa is in its interiors, both inside its buildings and in the hinterland away from the coastal area.Legends from Hindu mythology credit Lord Parshuram, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu with the creation of Goa. Over the centuries various dynasties have ruled Goa. Rashtrakutas, Kadambas, Silaharas, Chalukyas, Bahamani Muslims and most famously the Portuguese have been rulers of Goa. Goa was liberated by the Indian Army from Portuguese colonisation on December 19, 1961 and became an Union Territory along with the enclaves of Daman and Diu. On May 30, 1987 Goa was conferred statehood and became the 25th state of the Indian Republic. Having been the meeting point of races, religions and cultures of East and West over the centuries, Goa has a multi-hued and distinctive lifestyle quite different from the rest of India. Hindu and Catholic communities make up almost the entire population with minority representation of Muslims and other religions.\r\n','In the 3rd century BC Goa formed part of the Mauryan empire. Later it was ruled by the Satavahanas of Kolhapur and eventually passed to the Chalukyas of Badami from AD 580 to 750.\r\nGoa fell to the Muslims for the first time in 1312, but they weren’t fans of the beach and eventually left in 1370 under the forceful persuasion of Harihara I of the Vijayanagar mpire. During the next 100 years Goa’s harbours were important landing places for ships carrying Arabian horses for the Vijayanagar cavalry.\r\nBlessed as it is by natural harbours and wide rivers, Goa was the ideal base for the seafaring Portuguese, who arrived in 1510 aiming to control the spice route from the East. Jesuit missionaries led by St Francis Xavier arrived in 1542. For a while, Portuguese control was limited to a small area around Old Goa, but by the middle of the 16th century it had expanded to include the provinces of Bardez and Salcete.\r\nThe Marathas (the central Indian people who controlled much of India at various points in time) almost vanquished the Portuguese in the late 18th century, and there was a brief occupation by the British during the Napoleonic Wars in Europe. However, it was not until 1961, when the Indian army marched into Goa, that Portuguese occupation finally came to its end on the subcontinent.\r\nIn 1967, a Goan opinion poll showed that the state\'s residents didn\'t want to be assimilated into its neighbouring state Marharashtra, despite Maharashtra pushing for it. But it wasn\'t until 1987 that Goa was officially declared India\'s 25th state by Prime Minister Rajiv Ghandhi, in a landmark ruling for the state\'s generations of armed supporters. Five years later, Goa\'s local language, Konkani, was recognised as one of India\'s 22 official regional languages.\r\nToday, Goa has one of India’s highest per-capita incomes, with farming, fishing, tourism and iron-ore mining forming the basis of its economy.','goa',1,1,'beach-goa-india.jpeg','goa.jpg','goaattractions9.jpg','Goa_tour_package_1.jpg','2013-06-29 19:07:25','2013-07-09 06:40:56'),(8,'CJ','Gujarat',1,'https://maps.google.co.in/maps?q=gujarat&hl=en&sll=22.296567,70.802076&sspn=0.010979,0.021136&hnear=Gujarat&t=m&z=7&iwloc=A','Aavo Padharo, words of welcome in the language of Gujarat because it is here that these words ring truely and the guest is \'God\' and the people of Gujarat are gregariously friendly, inviting and will entice you to come again and again.\r\n\r\nHere in Gujarat you will discover centuries of history as spanning the geological core of the earth onto a fascinatingly vibrant future.

Pushyagupta, a Vaishya, was appointed Governor of Saurashtra by the Mauryan regime. He ruled (322 BC to 294 BC) Giringer (present Junagadh) and built a dam on the Sudarshan lake. Emperor Ashoka, the grandson of Chandragupta Maurya, not only ordered engraving of his famous edicts on the rock at Junagadh, but asked his Governor Tusherpha to take out canals from the lake where an earlier Mauryan Governor had built a dam. Between the decline of the Mauryan power and Saurashtra coming under the sway of Samprati Mauryas of Ujjain, there was a Greek incursion into Gujarat led by Demetrius.\r\nFor nearly 300 years from the start of the 1st century AD, Saka rulers played prominent part in Gujarat\'s history. Weather beaten rock at Junagadh gives a glimpse of the Ruler Rudradaman I (100 AD) of the Saka satraps known as Western Satraps, or Kshatraps. Mahakshatrap Rudradaman I founded the Kardamaka dynasty which ruled from Anupa on the banks of the Narmada up to Aparanta region which bordered Punjab. In Gujarat several battles were fought between the south Indian Satavahana dynasty and the Western Satraps. The greatest ruler of the Satavahana Dynasty was Gautamiputra Satakarni who defeated the Western Satraps and conquered some parts of Gujarat in the 2nd century CE','gujarat',1,1,'634964560935938673_5.jpg','Gujarat-mulls-single-window-facilitation-authority-for-film-tourism.jpg','sun-temple-gujarat.jpg','gujarat-tourism-pictures-2013.jpg','2013-06-29 19:07:25','2013-07-09 06:41:53'),(9,'HR','Haryana',1,'https://maps.google.co.in/maps?q=Haryana&hl=en&sll=22.482106,71.191406&sspn=5.175732,10.821533&hnear=Haryana&t=m&z=7','Its history is a rich tapestry of the ancient, the medieval and the modern.

People of Indus valley civilization pushed the original inhabitants of Ganga plains who were known as Kolorian people towards north. They moved to the hills of Himachal Pradesh where they could live peacefully and preserve their way of life. In the Vedas they have been referred to as Dasas, Dasyus and Nishadas while in later works they have been called Kinnars, Nagas and Yakshas. The Kols or Mundas are believed to be the original migrants to the hills of present day Himachal. The second phase of migrants came in the form of Mongoloid people known as Bhotas and Kiratas.

The word Kerala is first recorded (as Keralaputra) in a 3rd-century BCE rock inscription (Rock Edict 2) left by the Maurya emperor Asoka (274–237 BCE). The Land of Keralaputra was one of the four independent kingdoms in southern India during Asoka\'s time, the others being Chola, Pandya, and Satiyaputra.

The city tops the list of Indian States and Union Territories with the highest per capita income in the country at Rs.99,262 at current prices and Rs.70,361 at constant prices (2006–2007).[6] The city was reported in 2010 to be the \"cleanest\" in India, based on a national government study,[7] and the territory also headed the list of Indian states and territories according to research conducted using 2005 data by Human Development Index.\r\n','After the Partition of India in 1947, the former British province of Punjab was also split between east Punjab in India and west Punjab in Pakistany. The Indian Punjab required a new capital city to replace Lahore, which became part of Pakistan during the partition.[9] After several plans to make additions to existing cities were found to be unfeasible for various reasons, the decision to construct a new and planned city was undertaken. Of all the new town schemes in independent India, the Chandigarh project quickly assumed prime significance, because of the city\'s strategic location as well as the personal interest of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of independent India. Commissioned by Nehru to reflect the new nation\'s modern, progressive outlook, Chandigarh was designed by the French (born Swiss) architect and urban planner, Le Corbusier, in the 1950s. Le Corbusier was in fact the second architect of the city, after the initial master plan was prepared by the American architect-planner Albert Mayer who was working with the Polish-born architect Matthew Nowicki.[citation needed] Chandigarh hosts the largest of Le Corbusier\'s many Open Hand sculptures, standing 26 meters high. The Open Hand (La Main Ouverte) is a recurring motif in Le Corbusier\'s architecture, a sign for him of \"peace and reconciliation. It is open to give and open to receive.\" It represents the give and take of ideas.[10] On 1 November 1966, the newly formed Indian state of Haryana was carved out of the eastern portion of the Punjab, in order to create Haryana as a majority Hindi-speaking people, while the western portion of Punjab retained a mostly Punjabi language-speaking majority and remained as the current federated state of Punjab. However, the city of Chandigarh was on the border, and was thus created into a union territory to serve as capital of both these states.\r\n','chandigarh',0,1,'1461710-One_of_the_magnificent_vistas_in_the_Rock_Garden-Chandigarh.jpg','634903983320651071_chandigarh_big.jpg','chandigarh.jpg','pinjore_garden_chandigarh.jpg','2013-06-29 19:07:25','2013-07-09 06:47:10'),(32,'DN','Dadra and Nagar Haveli',1,'','','','dadra-and-nagar-haveli',0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2013-06-29 19:07:25','2013-07-08 18:54:59'),(33,'DD','Daman & Diu',1,'','','','daman-diu',0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2013-06-29 19:07:25','2013-07-08 18:54:38'),(34,'DL','Delhi',1,'https://maps.google.co.in/maps?q=Delhi&hl=en&sll=12.953997,77.63094&sspn=0.740097,1.352692&hnear=New+Delhi,+West+Delhi,+Delhi&t=m&z=10','Delhi is a city that bridges two diverse worlds.

In due course eight more cities came alive adjacent to Indraprastha: Lal Kot, Siri, Dinpanah, Quila Rai Pithora, Ferozabad, Jahanpanah, Tughlakabad and Shahjahanabad. Delhi has been a spectator to the political turmoil for over five centuries. It was ruled by the Mughals in progression to Khiljis and Tughlaqs. In 1192 the legions of the Afghan warrior Muhammad of Ghori captured the Rajput town, and the Delhi Sultanate was established (1206). The invasion of Delhi by Timur in 1398 put an end to the sultanate; the Lodis, last of the Delhi sultans, gave way to Babur, who, after the battle of Panipat in 1526, founded the Mughal Empire. The early Mughal emperors privileged Agra as their capital, and Delhi became their permanent seat only after Shah Jahan built (1638) the walls of Old Delhi.\r\n','delhi',1,1,'delhi1.jpg','india_gate_new_delhi.jpg','india-scenery-352-2.jpg','red.jpg','2013-06-29 19:07:25','2013-07-08 22:57:29'),(35,'LD','Lakshadweep',1,'','','','lakshadweep',0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2013-06-29 19:07:25','2013-07-08 18:54:21'),(36,'PY','Puducherry',1,'','','','puducherry',0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2013-06-29 19:07:25','2013-07-08 18:52:11');

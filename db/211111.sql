It a lively capital city and a business center with all the trappings of a modern metropolis but yet flavored strongly with an age-old charm that never fails to surprise a traveler. The old Jaipur painted in Pink can grip any visitor with esteem. Stunning backdrop of ancient forts: Nahargarh, Amer, Jaigarh and Moti Doongari are apt references of the bygone era and a reminder of their persistent romance and chivalry.','Jaipur is named after its founder, the warrior and astronomer sovereign, Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh (ruled 1688 to 1744). The choice to move out of his hilltop capital Amer was also compelled by reasons of growing population and scarcity of water. Moreover in the early 17th century the power of the great Mughals was dwindling with its aging Monarch Aurangzeb. After several centuries of attacks the north was now quiet and the wealth of the kingdom had considerably increased. Seizing upon this opportune time, Jai Singh planned his new capital in the plains. Jaipur is a corroborative indication of Sawai Jai Singh\'s strong grounding in science and astrology and of a Bengali architect Vidyadhar with a strong instinct for planning.','jaipur',1,1,'Amber_Fort-Jaipur-India0006.JPG','cpalace01.jpg','3678165.jpg','p3041587.jpg','2013-07-07 14:11:19','2013-07-08 20:05:27'),(2,'Agra',2,282001,283202,'https://www.google.co.in/maps?q=agra&hl=en&sll=27.250953,77.788345&sspn=1.350258,2.705383&hnear=Agra,+Uttar+Pradesh&t=m&z=12&iwloc=A','Agra’s magnificent white marble Taj Mahal stands like a bulbous beacon, drawing tourists like moths to a wondrous flame. Despite the hype, it’s every bit as good as you’ve heard. While Agra itself is a sprawling, bloated and polluted industrial city that few travellers seem to have a good word for, the Taj is not a stand-alone attraction. The legacy of the Mughal empire has left a magnificent fort and a sprinkling of fascinating tombs and mausoleums, while the Yamuna River provides a suitably sacred backdrop. The Mughal emperor Babur established his capital here in 1526, and for the next century Agra witnessed a remarkable spate of architectural activity as each emperor tried to outdo the grandiose monuments built by his predecessors. The city has a lively but chaotic chowk (marketplace) and plenty of places to stay and eat, but the hordes of rickshaw-wallahs, touts, unofficial guides and souvenir vendors can be as persistent as the monsoon rain. Many tourists choose to visit Agra on a whistle-stop day trip – made possible by the excellent train services from Delhi. However, Agra’s attractions are much more than can be seen in a day, and if you have the time you can enjoy several days’ sightseeing with side trips to Fatehpur Sikri and Mathura.','In 1501, Sultan Sikander Lodi established his capital here, but the city fell into Mughal hands in 1526, when Emperor Babur defeated the last Lodi sultan at Panipat, 80km north of Delhi. Agra reached the peak of its magnificence between the mid-16th and mid-17th centuries during the reigns of Akbar, Jehangir and Shah Jahan. During this period the fort, the Taj Mahal and other major mausoleums were built. In 1638 Shah Jahan built a new city in Delhi, and his son Aurangzeb moved the capital there 10 years later. In 1761 Agra fell to the Jats, a warrior class who looted its monuments, including the Taj Mahal. The Marathas took over in 1770, but were replaced by the British in 1803. Following the Uprising of 1857, the British shifted the administration of the province to Allahabad. Deprived of its administrative role, Agra developed as a centre for heavy industry, quickly becoming famous for its chemicals industry and atmospheric pollution, before the Taj and tourism became a major source of income.','agra',1,1,'agra_fort_india-normal.jpg','taj-nature-walk10.jpg','taj_mahal-in-morning.jpg','The-Courtyard-of-Sikandra.jpg','2013-07-07 15:31:59','2013-07-08 21:53:11'),(3,'Jhansi',2,284001,285251,'https://maps.google.co.in/maps?q=Jhansi&hl=en&sll=25.456959,78.576731&sspn=0.079047,0.169086&hnear=Jhansi,+Uttar+Pradesh&t=m&z=11','Jhansi is a historic city of northern India, located on the banks of the Pahuj or Pushpavati River, in the state of Uttar Pradesh. It is located in the region of Bundelkhand. Jhansi is the administrative headquarters of Jhansi District and Jhansi Division. The original walled city grew up around its stone fort, which crowns a neighboring rock. This district is on the banks of the Betwa River. The city is situated between the rivers Pahuj and Betwa between North longitudes 24°11´ and 25°57´and East latitudes 78°10´and 79°25´. It has an average elevation of 284 metres (935 feet). The boundary of the city is irregular, the northern boundary being contiguous with that of the district of Jalaun. Jhansi is well connected to all other major towns in Uttar Pradesh by road and railway networks. It is about 415 km from New Delhi and 292 km from Lucknow, and is called the Gateway to Bundelkhand. The National Highway Development Project has supported development of Jhansi. The north-south corridor connecting Kashmir to Kanyakumari passes through Jhansi as does the East-West corridor; consequently there has been a sudden rush to infrastructure and real estate development in the city. A greenfield airport development has been planned.','Jhansi was a stronghold of the Chandela kings. Balwant Nagar was the name of this place. But in 11th century Jhansi lost its importance. In 17th century under Raja Bir Singh Deo of Orchha (Jhansi) again rose to prominence. Raja Bir Singh Deo had good relations with the Mughal emperor Jehangir. In five year construction period. Raja Bir Singh Deo got constructed the Jhansi fort and around it got established a BALWANT NAGAR which later on named jhansi.In 1817 the Maratha Peshwa in Pune had ceded all his rights over Bundelkhand to the Company. After the death of Shiv Rao his grandson Ramchandra Rao was made subedar of Jhansi. He was not a good administrator. Ramchandra Rao died in 1835. The financial position of Jhansi was very critical. However the raja was a cultured man who was able to enrich the architecture of the city and acquire a fine library of Sanskrit manuscripts, though he was without issue. Raja Ganghadar Rao adopted a child called Anand Rao, the son of his cousin, who was renamed Damodar Rao, on the day before he died. The adoption was in the presence of the British political officer who was given a letter from the raja requesting that the child should be treated with kindness and that the government of Jhansi should be given to his widow for her lifetime. After the death of the raja in November 1853 because Damodar Rao was adopted, the British East India Company, under Governor-General Lord Dalhousie, applied the Doctrine of Lapse, rejecting Damodar Rao\'s claim.

In 2011, it was ranked the world\'s 130th fastest growing city. Allahabad city is the largest commercial center in the state; it also has the second-highest per capita income and the third greatest GDP in the state (following Kanpur). Allahabad is also known as the \"city of prime ministers\" because post independence seven out of 13 prime minister of India belonged to Allahabad (Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Gulzarilal Nanda, Vishwanath Pratap Singh and Chandra Shekhar). All these seven leaders were either born in Allahabad, were alumni of Allahabad University, or were elected from a constituency in Allahabad.','The city of Allahabad is among the largest cities of Uttar Pradesh and situated at the confluence of three rivers- Ganga, Yamuna and the invisible Saraswati.

And you can let your eyes caress the sloping sand dunes while you ramble your way in a camel safari. The desert citadel is truly a golden fantasy in the Thar Desert. Bhati Rajput ruler Rawal Jaisal, after whom the city finds its name, founded Jaisalmer in 1156 AD.','Over the years the remote location of Jaisalmer kept it almost uninjured by outside influences. In the 14th century AD. Ala-ud-din Khilji, the Sultan of Delhi besieged the fort for nine years in an effort to take back the treasure looted by the Bhatti Rajputs from his imperial caravan train. When the fall of the fort was imminent the women of the fort committed Jauhar, an act of mass self-sacrifice, while men donned saffron robes and rode to their certain death.

In 1541 AD they even fought Mughal Emperor Humayun, though their families with the Mughals were not always hostile. Sabal Simha won the patronage of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan for his distinctions in battlefield, in Peshawar and thus earned the right to rule Jaisalmer.

It is holiest of the seven sacred cities (Sapta Puri) in Hinduism and Jainism. Hindus believe that death at Varanasi brings salvation. It is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world and the oldest in India. Many of its temples were plundered and destroyed by Mohammad Ghauri in the 12th century. The temples and religious institutions in the city now are dated to the 18th century. ','According to legend, Varanasi was founded by the god Shiva. The Pandavas, the heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata are also stated to have visited the city in search of Shiva to atone for their sins of fratricide and Br?hmanahatya that they had committed during the climactic Kurukshetra war . It is regarded as one of seven holy cities which can provide Moksha. The earliest known archaeological evidence suggests that settlement around Varanasi in the Ganga valley (the seat of Aryan religion and philosophy) began in the 11th or 12th century BC, placing it among the world\'s oldest continually inhabited cities. These archaeological remains suggest that the Varanasi area was populated by Vedic people. However, the Atharvaveda (the oldest known text referencing the city), which dates to approximately the same period, suggests that the area was populated by indigenous tribes. It is possible that archaeological evidence of these previous inhabitants has yet to be discovered. Varanasi was also home to Parshva, the 23rd Jain Tirthankara and the earliest Tirthankara accepted as a historical figure in the 8th century BC.

The new city is outside the structure.','The Rathores enjoyed good relations with the Mughals. Maharaja Jaswant Singh (1678) supported Shah Jahan in the latter\'s war of succession. The relations with the Mughals soured during the reign of Aurangzeb who launched a crusade against the Hindus, made preparations to bring the state of Marwar under his control, ordered demotion of temples and revival of Jeziya. After Aurangzeb\'s death, Maharaja Ajit Singh drove out the Mughals from Ajmer and added it to Marwar. In the reign of Maharaja Umed Singh Jodhpur grew into a modern city.

Lucknow has always been known as a multicultural city and flourished as a cultural and artistic capital of North India in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today it continues as an important centre of commerce, aerospace, finance, pharmaceuticals, technology, design, culture, tourism, music and poetry. Lucknow ranked 6th among all the cities in India for fastest job-creation.

The city is on the northwestern shore of Gomti river, which flows through it. Lucknow is accessible from every part of India through air, rail and road.','Many independent kingdoms, such as Awadh, were established when the Mughal empire disintegrated. The third Nawab, Shuja-ud-Daula, fell out with the British after aiding the fugitive Nawab of Bengal Mir Qasim. He was comprehensively defeated in the Battle of Buxar by the East India Company, which forced him to pay heavy penalties and cede parts of his territory. Awadh’s capital, Lucknow rose to prominence when Asaf-ud-Daula, the fourth nawab, shifted his court here from Faizabad in 1775. The British appointed a resident in 1773 and over time gained control of more territory and authority in the state. They were, however, disinclined to capture Awadh outright and be brought face to face with the Marathas and the remnants of the Mughal Empire. In 1798, the fifth Nawab Wazir Ali Khan alienated both his people and the British, and was forced to abdicate. The British then helped Saadat Ali Khan to the throne. Saadat Ali Khan was a puppet king, who in the treaty of 1801 ceded half of Awadh to the British East India Company and also agreed to disband his troops in favour of a hugely expensive, British-run army. This treaty effectively made the state of Awadh a vassal to the British East India Company, though it nationally continued to be part of the Mughal Empire in name until 1819. The treaty of 1801 formed an arrangement that was very beneficial to the Company. They were able to use Awadh\'s vast treasuries, repeatedly digging into them for loans at reduced rates. In addition, the revenues from running Awadh\'s armed forces brought them useful revenues while it acted as a buffer state. The Nawabs were ceremonial kings, busy with pomp and show but with little influence over matters of state. By the mid-nineteenth century, however, the British had grown impatient with the arrangement and wanted direct control of Awadh.','lucknow',1,1,'La_Martini_re_College__Lucknow_-_1880_s.jpg','Bada-Imbarra-Lucknow.jpg','India_Lucknow_Hotel.jpg','Lucknow.jpg','2013-07-07 15:51:23','2013-07-08 21:37:46'),(10,'Udaipur',1,307025,313906,'<iframe width=\"425\" height=\"350\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"https://maps.google.co.in/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Udaipur,+Rajasthan&amp;aq=0&amp;oq=Uda,+Rajasthan&amp;sll=26.238947,73.024','Udaipur is often called ‘Venice of the East’.

Maharana Udai Singh died in 1572 and was succeeded by Maharana Pratap who valiantly defended Udaipur from Mughal attacks. Maharana Pratap is the most revered Rajput icon who gallantly fought the Mughals at the battle of Haldighati in 1576.

In 1535 Bahadur Shah, the Sultan of Gujarat, besieged the fort causing immense carnage. It is said that 32000 men donned the saffron robes of martyrdom and rode out to face certain death. The women folk led by Rani Karnawati committed Jauhar (collective self immolation by fire) to save their honor.','In 1568 Mughal Emperor Akbar conquered it. In 1616, Mughal Emperor Jehangir restored the fort to the Rajputs. Now, a new township sprawls below the hill on the west side. According to the legend the construction of the fort was started by Bhim, a Pandav hero of mythological epic Mahabharata. The fort has many magnificent monuments. Even though the fort mostly is in ruins, it stands as an overwhelming reminder of its past history of triumph and tragedy and its walls resonate with unbelievable legend of extraordinary men and women and their equally astounding deeds.','chittorgarh',1,1,'Kirti_stambh.jpg','Chittorgarh-Fort-Wallpaper-Hd.jpg','Oil_painting_of_Padmini_s_palace_in_the_fort_in_the_midst_of_the_tank.jpg','Siddheshwar_Temple.JPG','2013-07-07 15:57:12','2013-07-09 22:00:05'),(12,'Ajmer',1,305001,305927,'<iframe width=\"425\" height=\"350\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"https://maps.google.co.in/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Ajmer,+Rajasthan&amp;aq=0&amp;oq=ajmer+Rajasthan&amp;sll=24.888744,74.6269','South west of Jaipur, Ajmer is an oasis wrapped in the green hills.

Especially famous is the Dargah Sharif-tomb of the Sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti, which is equally revered both by the Hindus and the Muslims. Ajmer is a centre of culture and education. The British chose Ajmer for its prestigious Mayo College, a school exclusively for Indian nobility at one time. However, now it is one of the best public schools in the country. Ajmer is also the base for visiting Pushkar (14 km.) which has the distinction of having the only Brahma temple in the world. The Picturesque Pushkar Lake is a sacred spot for Hindus. During the month of Kartik (Oct/Nov), devotees throng in large numbers to take a dip in the sacred lake.','Ajmer was also a favourite residence for the great Mughals. One of the first contacts between the Mughal King Jahangir and Sir Thomas Roe took place here in 1616. The Scindias took over the city in 1818 and then handed it over to the British.

The Hada-ruled state of Bundi included the present-day districts of Baran, Bundi, Kota, and Jhalawar. The Chauhan clan got scattered after Prithviraj Chauhan’s defeat by Sultan Mohammed Ghouri in 1193 AD. Few of them moved towards Mewar and the rest of the young warriors reached the Chambal valley. They conquered local Meena and Bhil tribal rulers and established their own kingdom of Hadoti. Eventually two branches of Hadas formed two Princely states of Kota and Bundi, on either side of the river Chambal. The sportive and adventurous rulers of Hadoti loved, enjoyed and protected the wildlife and forests of their region. Kota and Bundi states have protected forests preserved by the Hada rulers. The Hadas rulers controlled the Hadoti region for centuries from 1193AD. They conquered Bundi in 1241 and Kota in 1264. Decline of Bundi rule on the other districts began in 1579. Kota regained the status of an independent state and in 1838; Jhalawar also became a separate state.

Delhi has been the seat of power for several rulers and many empires for about a millennium. Many a times the city was built, destroyed and then rebuilt here. fascinatingly, a number of Delhi\'s rulers played a dual role, first as destroyers and then as creators. Delhi has been the political hub of India. Every political activity in the country traces its roots here. This was true even of the legendary era. The Pandavas of the Mahabharata had their capital at Indraprastha, which is believed to have been geographically located in today\'s Delhi. ','The history of the city is as old as the epic Mahabharata. The town was known as Indraprastha, where Pandavas used to live. In due course eight more cities came alive adjacent to Indraprastha: Lal Kot, Siri, Dinpanah, Quila Rai Pithora, Ferozabad, Jahanpanah, Tughlakabad and Shahjahanabad. Delhi has been a spectator to the political turmoil for over five centuries. It was ruled by the Mughals in progression to Khiljis and Tughlaqs. In 1192 the legions of the Afghan warrior Muhammad of Ghori captured the Rajput town, and the Delhi Sultanate was established (1206). The invasion of Delhi by Timur in 1398 put an end to the sultanate; the Lodis, last of the Delhi sultans, gave way to Babur, who, after the battle of Panipat in 1526, founded the Mughal Empire.

It is connected by air, rail and road to all major cities of the country and has direct international connections to many cities worldwide. ','The region of modern day Bangalore was part of several successive South Indian kingdoms. After centuries of the rule of the Western Gangas, the region was captured by the Cholas in 1024. In 1116 the Hoysala Empire overthrew the Cholas and extended its rule over the region. Modern Bangalore had its beginning in 1537 by a vassal of the Vijayanagara Empire, Kempé Gowda I, who built a mud-brick fort at the site that would become the central part of modern Bangalore. Kempé Gowda referred to the new town as his \"gandubh?mi\" or \"Land of Heroes\". Within the fort, the town was divided into smaller divisions—each called a \"pete\". The town had two main streets—Chikkapeté Street, which ran east-west, and Doddapeté Street, which ran north-south. Their intersection formed the Doddapeté Square—the heart of Bangalore. Kempé Gowda\'s successor, Kempé Gowda II, built four towers that marked Bangalore\'s boundary.

A succession of Hindu dynasties held sway over the islands from the 6th century AD until the Muslim Sultans of Gujarat annexed the area in the 14th century, eventually ceding it to Portugal in 1534. The only memorable contribution the Portuguese made to the area was christening it Bom Bahai, before throwing the islands in with the dowry of Catherine of Braganza when she married England’s Charles II in 1661. The British government took possession of the islands in 1665, but leased them three years later to the East India Company for the paltry annual rent of UK£10. Then called Bombay, the area flourished as a trading port. So much so that within 20 years the presidency of the East India Company was transferred to Bombay from Surat. Bombay’s fort was completed in the 1720s, and a century later ambitious land reclamation projects joined the islands into today’s single landmass.

Kutch was formerly an independent kingdom, founded in the late 13th century by a Samma Rajput branch called Jadeja Rajputs. The Jadeja dynasty ruled not only Kutch but also much of neighboring Kathiawar for several centuries until the independence of India in 1947. In 1815 Kutch became a British protectorate and ultimately a Princely State of Cutch, whose local ruler acknowledged British sovereignty in return for local autonomy.

One surviving relic of the princely era is the beautiful Aina Mahal (\"mirror palace\"), built in the 1760s at Bhuj for the Maharao of Kutch by Ram Singh Malam who had learnt glass, enamel and tile work from the Dutch.

','Junagadh remained important as a regional capital until the 5th century. Then under the Rajputs and Solankis it was less important, as power centers shifted to near Bhavnagar (until the 10th century), later to Patan (until the 15th century), where it stayed when the whole of Gujarat became a province of the Delhi Sultanate, and then to Ahmedabad when Gujarat again became an independent Sultanate.  The Mughals took over in the early 16th century, and continued to rule from Ahmedabad, so it was not until the mid 18th century as Mughal rule was in decline that Junagadh once again became an independent princely state, established by an Afghan named Sher Khan Babi, with its capital here.','junagadh',1,1,'junagadh_fort.jpg','12_full.jpg','167063387_967e945793_o.jpg','DSC03010.JPG','2013-07-08 21:27:16','2013-07-08 21:27:16'),(22,'Vadodara',8,391421,391165,'https://maps.google.co.in/maps?q=Vadodara&hl=en&sll=23.733733,69.859741&sspn=2.564379,5.410767&hnear=Vadodara,+Gujarat&t=m&z=11','If you seek the stillness of earth before the human empire, then imagine prehistoric times when the humans here on the banks of the river Vishwamitri, were outnumbered by vad, or banyan trees, from which the place derived its name.

But Bengalis have long been infuriated by one-sided depictions of their vibrant capital. Kolkata is locally regarded as the intellectual and cultural capital of the nation. Several of India’s great 19th- and 20th-century heroes were Kolkatans, including guru-philosopher Ramakrishna, Nobel Prize–winning poet Rabindranath Tagore and celebrated film director Satyajit Ray. Dozens of venues showcase Bengali dance, poetry, art, music, film and theatre.

The city was a colonial city developed by the British East India Company and then by the British Empire. Kolkata was the capital of the British Indian empire until 1911 when the capital was relocated to Delhi. Kolkata grew rapidly in the 19th century to become the second city of the British Empire. This was accompanied by the development of a culture that fused European philosophies with Indian tradition. The city is also noted for its revolutionary history, ranging from the Indian struggle for independence to the leftist Naxalite and trade-union movements. Labelled the \"Cultural Capital of India\", \"The City of Processions\", \"The City of Palaces\", and the \"City of Joy\", Kolkata has also been home to prominent people such as Thakur Shri Ramakrishna Paramhamsa, Maa Sarada Devi, Swami Vivekananda, Rabindranath Tagore, Subhas Chandra Bose, A.

It is noted for its tea industry and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Darjeeling is the headquarters of Darjeeling district which has a partially autonomous status within the state of West Bengal.\r\nThe development of the town dates back to the mid-19th century, when the colonial British administration set up a sanatorium and a military depot. Subsequently, extensive tea plantation was done in the region, and tea growers developed hybrids of black tea and created new fermentation techniques. The resultant distinctive Darjeeling tea is internationally recognised and ranks among the most popular of the black tea’s. \r\n','The history of Darjeeling is intertwined with that of Bengal, Sikkim and Nepal. Until the early 19th century, the hilly area around Darjeeling was controlled by the kingdom of Sikkim, while the plains around Siliguri were intermittently occupied by the kingdom of Nepal, with settlement consisting of a few villages of Lepcha and Kirati people. In 1828, a delegation of the British East India Company (BEIC) officials on its way to the Nepal-Sikkim border stayed in Darjeeling and decided that the region was a suitable site for a sanatorium for British soldiers. The company negotiated a lease of the area west of the Mahananda River from the Chogyal of Sikkim in 1835. In 1849, the BEIC director Arthur Campbell and the explorer and botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker were imprisoned in the region by the Sikkim Chogyal. The BEIC sent a force to free them. Continued friction between the BEIC and the Sikkim authorities resulted in the annexation of 640 square miles (1,700 km2) of territory by the British in 1850. In 1864, the Bhutanese rulers and the British signed the Treaty of Sinchula that ceded the passes leading through the hills and Kalimpong to the British.[9] Further discord between Sikkim and the British resulted in a war, culminating in the signing of a treaty and the annexation by the British of the area east of the Teesta River in 1865. By 1866, Darjeeling district had assumed its current shape and size, covering an area of 1,234 square miles (3,200 km2).\r\n\r\n','darjeeling',1,1,'Darjeeling-Toy-Train-Photo.jpg','the_tea_gardens_of_darjeeling.jpg','Toy_Train_Darjeeling_West_Bengal_India__3_.JPG','Darjeeling2.jpg','2013-07-15 16:09:19','2013-07-15 16:09:19'),(49,'Bagdogra',29,NULL,NULL,'','A quaint sight greets the travellers when they arrive in this small town of Bagdogra, located in the Darjeeling District of West Bengal.

Bagdogra being a tea growing area provides a spectacular array of tea for the tea lovers, which have been an attraction for tourists for many years now. A visit to Bagdogra promises an enticing experience because of the heavenly view of the great eastern Himalayan range.\r\nBeing a hill station, Bagdogra offers its travellers an opportunity to experience adventure sport such as white water rafting in the rapids of the Teesta River. The Teesta River flows near the town of Bagdogra, which serves as a point of fishing and angling too. Tista or Teesta, as it is more famously known, is a humble yet turbulent river depending on the season one chooses to visit. Best season to visit Bagdogra is between October to March, as one can truly enjoy the experience of visiting the various beautiful locations in and around this small town. River Teesta is said to have fierce rapids which make the experience of white water rafting adventurous yet dangerous.

Kalimpong and neighbouring Darjeeling were major centres calling for a separate Gorkhaland state in the 1980s.\r\n','Until the mid-19th century, the area around Kalimpong was ruled in succession by the Sikkimese and Bhutanese kingdoms. Under Sikkimese rule, the area was known as Dalingkot. In 1706, the king of Bhutan won this territory from the Sikkimese monarch and renamed it Kalimpong. Overlooking the Teesta Valley, Kalimpong is believed to have once been the forward position of the Bhutanese in the 18th century. The area was sparsely populated by the indigenous Lepcha community and migrant Bhutia and Limbu tribes. Later in 1780, the Gurkhas invaded and conquered Kalimpong. After the Anglo-Bhutan War in 1864, the Treaty of Sinchula (1865) was signed, in which Bhutanese held territory east of the Teesta River was ceded to the British East India Company. \r\nFollowing Indian independence in 1947, Kalimpong became part of the state of West Bengal, after Bengal was partitioned between India and Pakistan. With China\'s annexation of Tibet in 1959, many Buddhist monks fled Tibet and established monasteries in Kalimpong. These monks also brought many rare Buddhist scriptures with them. In 1962, the permanent closure of the Jelep Pass after the Sino-Indian War disrupted trade between Tibet and India, and led to a slowdown in Kalimpong\'s economy.

Either the name \"Dibru\" evolved from Dibaru river or from the Dimasa word \"Dibru\" which means a \"blister\" and \"Garh\" meaning \"fort\". Both \"Dibru\" and \"Dibaru\" are Dimasa words. The Dimasas add the prefix \"Di-\" (which means \"water\") wherever there is small stream, a river, or a large river in a town or city. For example, \"Diphu\" (which means \"white-water\"), \"Dimapur\" (city with great river), etc. When the British came to this region, they constructed a fort on the bank of the river Dibaru. Therefore, this might be considered as the source of the name \"Dibrugarh\".\r\nThe British arrived in Assam in the year 1826, following the Yandaboo Accord. They selected Dibrugarh as an administrative and commercial center in Upper Assam, making Dibrugarh a hub of activity in this region of north-eastern India. In the year 1842, Dibrugarh was announced as the Headquarter of Lakhimpur District. During World War II, the town was the principal military base and was used as a transit camp for the evacuees from Burma. In 1971 the Dibrugarh Sub-Division itself became a full fledged district. Later, the Tinsukia Sub-Division separated as a District in 1989 from Dibrugarh District.

It was known as Pragjyotishpura and Durjoya in different periods and was the capital under the Varman Dynasty and the Pala dynasties of the Kamarupa kingdom.

The city remained as the capital of Assam till the 10th-11th century AD under the rulers of the Pala dynasty.

The recorded history of the city began in the colonial times, specifically with the arrival of British East India Company and the establishment of Fort St. George in 1644. The British defended several attacks from the French colonial forces, and from the kingdom of Mysore, on Chennai\'s way to becoming a major naval port and presidency city by the late eighteenth century. Following the independence of India, Chennai became the capital of Tamil Nadu and an important centre of regional politics that tended to bank on the Dravidian identity of the populace.\r\n','The region around Chennai has served as an important administrative, military, and economic centre for many centuries. During 1st century CE, a poet and weaver named Thiruvalluvar lived in the town of Mylapore (a neighbourhood of present Chennai). From 1st century CE until 12th CE the region of present Tamil Nadu and parts of south India was ruled by the Cholas. Stone age implements have been found near Pallavaram in Chennai. According to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Pallavaram was a megalithic cultural establishment, and pre-historic communities resided in the settlement. \r\nThe Portuguese first arrived in 1522 and built a port called São Tomé after the Christian apostle, St. Thomas, who is believed to have preached in the area between 52 and 70 AD. In 1612, the Dutch established themselves near Pulicat, north of Chennai. On 22 August 1639, which is referred to as Madras Day, the British East India Company under Francis Day bought a small strip of land stretching 3 miles on the Coromandel Coast.

The magnificent scenic beauty and the architectural splendours of its temples, churches and old houses have made Goa a firm favorite with travelers around the world. But then, Goa is much more than just beaches and sea. It has a soul which goes deep into unique history, rich culture and some of the prettiest natural scenery that India has to offer. Much of the real Goa is in its interiors, both inside its buildings and in the hinterland away from the coastal area.Legends from Hindu mythology credit Lord Parshuram, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu with the creation of Goa. Over the centuries various dynasties have ruled Goa. Rashtrakutas, Kadambas, Silaharas, Chalukyas, Bahamani Muslims and most famously the Portuguese have been rulers of Goa. Goa was liberated by the Indian Army from Portuguese colonisation on December 19, 1961 and became an Union Territory along with the enclaves of Daman and Diu. On May 30, 1987 Goa was conferred statehood and became the 25th state of the Indian Republic. Having been the meeting point of races, religions and cultures of East and West over the centuries, Goa has a multi-hued and distinctive lifestyle quite different from the rest of India. Hindu and Catholic communities make up almost the entire population with minority representation of Muslims and other religions.\r\n','In the 3rd century BC Goa formed part of the Mauryan empire. Later it was ruled by the Satavahanas of Kolhapur and eventually passed to the Chalukyas of Badami from AD 580 to 750. Goa fell to the Muslims for the first time in 1312, but they weren’t fans of the beach and eventually left in 1370 under the forceful persuasion of Harihara I of the Vijayanagar mpire. During the next 100 years Goa’s harbours were important landing places for ships carrying Arabian horses for the Vijayanagar cavalry. Blessed as it is by natural harbours and wide rivers, Goa was the ideal base for the seafaring Portuguese, who arrived in 1510 aiming to control the spice route from the East. Jesuit missionaries led by St Francis Xavier arrived in 1542. For a while, Portuguese control was limited to a small area around Old Goa, but by the middle of the 16th century it had expanded to include the provinces of Bardez and Salcete. The Marathas (the central Indian people who controlled much of India at various points in time) almost vanquished the Portuguese in the late 18th century, and there was a brief occupation by the British during the Napoleonic Wars in Europe. However, it was not until 1961, when the Indian army marched into Goa, that Portuguese occupation finally came to its end on the subcontinent. In 1967, a Goan opinion poll showed that the state\'s residents didn\'t want to be assimilated into its neighbouring state Marharashtra, despite Maharashtra pushing for it. But it wasn\'t until 1987 that Goa was officially declared India\'s 25th state by Prime Minister Rajiv Ghandhi, in a landmark ruling for the state\'s generations of armed supporters. Five years later, Goa\'s local language, Konkani, was recognised as one of India\'s 22 official regional languages. Today, Goa has one of India’s highest per-capita incomes, with farming, fishing, tourism and iron-ore mining forming the basis of its economy.\r\n','goa',1,1,'13037467-tropical-beach-of-palolem-goa-india-1024x768.jpg','College_Party_Crowd.JPG','Candolim_beach_Goa-10.JPG','candolim-beach-goa.jpg','2013-07-15 17:09:26','2013-07-15 17:09:26'),(55,'Kochi ',14,NULL,NULL,'https://maps.google.co.in/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=kochi&amp;sll=9.931233,76.267304&amp;sspn=0.090294,0.169086&amp;gl=in&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Kochi,+Ernakulam,+Kerala&amp;t=m&amp;z=12&amp;ll=9.931233,76.267304&amp;outp','Kochi , formerly Cochin, is a major port city on the west coast of India by the Arabian Sea and is part of the district of Ernakulam of the state of Kerala.

The earliest documented references to Kochi occur in books written by Chinese voyager Ma Huan during his visit to Kochi in the 15th century as part of Admiral Zheng He\'s treasure fleet. There are also references to Kochi in accounts written by Italian traveller Niccolò Da Conti, who visited Kochi in 1440.\r\nAccording to many historians, the precursor state to Kingdom of Kochi came into existence in early 12th century, after the fall of the Chera Kingdom. The reign of the Kingdom was hereditary, and the family that ruled over the region was known as the Perumpadappu rulers in the local vernacular. The mainland Kochi remained the capital of the princely state since the 18th century. The King of Kochi only had authority over the region encompassing the present city of Kochi and adjoining areas. However, during much of this time, the kingdom was under foreign suzerainty, and the King often only had titular privileges.\r\n','kochi',1,1,'45536903.jpg','1308824992_cherai-beach-kochi-india_1152_13026087104-tpfil02aw-8079.jpg','koch.jpg','Last-Buoy-At-Kochi-In-Arabian-Sea.jpg','2013-07-15 18:18:56','2013-07-15 18:18:56');

Love it or loathe it – and most visitors see-saw between the two – India will jostle your entire being. It’s a place that fi res the imagination and stirs the soul like nowhere else on earth.\r\nSpectacularly Diverse\r\nWith its in-your-face diversity – from snowdusted mountains to sun-washed beaches, tranquil temples to frenetic bazaars, lantern-lit villages to software-supremo cities – it’s hardly surprising that this country has been dubbed the world’s most multidimensional. For those seeking spiritual sustenance, India has oodles of sacrosanct sites and thought-provoking philosophies, while history buffs will stumble upon gems from the past almost everywhere – grand vestiges of former empires serenely peer over swarming streets and crumbling fortresses loom high above plunging ravines. Meanwhile, aficionados of the great outdoors can paddle in the shimmering waters\r\nof one of many beautiful beaches, scout for big jungle cats on blood-pumping wildlife safaris, or simply inhale pine-scented air on meditative forest walks. And then there are the festivals. With its vibrant mix of religious denominations, India is home to a formidable array of celebrations – from larger-than-life extravaganzas with caparisoned elephants and body-twisting acrobats to pint-sized harvest fairs paying homage to a locally worshipped deity.\r\nToo Delicious\r\nBrace yourself – you’re about to jump on board one of the wildest culinary trips of your life! Frying, simmering, sizzling, kneading and flipping a deliciously diverse variety of regional dishes, feasting your way through the subcontinent is certainly one hell of a ride. The hungry traveller can look forward to a bountiful smorgasbord of tasty delights, ranging from the spicy goodness of masterfully marinated chicken drumsticks in North India to the simple splendour of squidgy rice dumplings in the steamy south. So what are you waiting for? Roll up your sleeves, put on your chompchomp hat and rumble your way down India’s gastronomic highway!','India’s story is one of the grand epics of world history. Throughout thousands of years of great civilisations, invasions, the birth of religions and countless cataclysms, India has time and again proved itself to be, in the words of its first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, ‘a bundle of contradictions held together by strong but invisible threads’. Indian history has always been a work-in-progress, a constant process of reinvention and accumulation that can prove elusive for those seeking to grasp its essential essence. And yet, from its myriad upheavals, a vibrant, diverse and thoroughly modern nation has emerged, as enduring as it is dynamic and increasingly well equipped to meet the challenges of the future.\r\n','india',1,1,'307870932_b0a207a66d_b.jpg','Gadi_Sagar_Temple_Jaisalmer_Rajasthan_India_1440x1080.jpg','Gate-way-of-India.jpg','photo-of-varanasi-uttar-pradesh-india-cultural-tourism-107974.jpg','2013-07-08 05:02:51','2013-07-08 05:02:51');

Cauthy and is one of the landmarks of Landour. The house and two acre estate are situated slightly above and to the east of St. Paul\'s Church and the old cantonment parade ground, which is now Char Dukan. Like many houses in Mussoorie, its name is taken from the writings of Sir Walter Scott, whose book-length poem describes heroic battles near the original Rokeby Castle in England. \r\n Several years after it was built, the house came into the possession of Lt. Col. Reilly, who also owned Ralston, another residence in Mussoorie. In 1878, Reilly mortgaged both properties for Rs. 25,000 to Frederick \'Pahari\' Wilson, a controversial adventurer and entrepreneur, who was the inspiration for Rudyard Kipling\'s classic story, \"The Man Who Would Be King\". Wilson minted his own gold coins and carved out his personal domain along the headwaters of the Ganga, at Harsil, harvesting timber and introducing apples to the Himalayas. Pahari Wilson and his Garhwali wife, Gulabi, are buried in the cemetery on Camel\'s Back Road. \r\n In 1891, Rokeby was purchased from the estate of Wilson\'s son, Henry, for Rs. 10,000, by Rev. J.S. Woodside, one of the founders of Woodstock School. It then passed into the hands of Dr. J. Symington, of Carthage North Carolina, who sold it to the Woman\'s Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1930. They converted it into a boarding house for young missionary ladies who were studying Urdu and Hindi at the Landour Language School. The first managers of this boarding house were Miss A.E. Lawson and Miss Ida Farmer. \r\n Methodist missionaries continued to operate the property as a guest house throughout the rest of the 20th century. Today, Rokeby has been carefully restored to its original glory. This heritage building is resplendent with character in its elaborate brick arches and niches, intricate stone walls, real wood floors and beams, and cosy fireplaces. Nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas, the traditions of bygone years – where colonial officers, renegade soldiers of fortune and pious miss saibs lived under one roof – can still be felt.

An enemy, in order to avenge the killing of his brother, plotted to assassinate the young Prince Jagat Singh of Mewar. His plans were over-heard by Khemraj Dadhivadia whilst he was having his sword sharpened in the market place. Khemraj didn’t utter a word of what he had heard to anyone and left quietly. On the fateful day when the young prince was out hunting, the would-be assassin charged up towards him, intent on murder. When the deadly blade of the enemy’s sword was inches away from the prince, Khemraj leapt out from nowhere, and with a single stroke of his sword, beheaded the attacker. To honour this gallant act, Mewar’s grateful Maharana rewarded Khemraj Dadhivadia with a village and named it Khempur.\r\nThe title ‘Ravla’ in Rajasthan refers to the home of a village chieftain”. In earlier days, the Ravla was the focal point of the entire village. Functions such as village welfare, collection of taxes, administration of law and order, and the initiation of festivals took place in the Ravla. Ravla Khempur exudes historical ambience and is graced with breathtaking surroundings. The lofty terraces, open courtyards, sprawling gardens, domes, arches and canopied balconies transport one back in time. Khempur village developed over the centuries to one side of the Ravla. It comprises a small, random and attractive cluster of typical rural dwellings and shops, and shaded squares where the villagers discuss the affairs of the world or share the local gossip. For the visitor, this is a side of India that has its own fascination; the cheerful welcome and natural hospitality of the village folk who ask nothing more than to enjoy a chat over a cup of tea. Beyond the village is an expanse of verdant farmland stretching off towards distant mountains: not a single blot on the landscape to spoil this serenely beautiful panorama.',' Village & Post: Khempur, Via: Mavli-313203,      District: Udaipur,       Rajasthan, INDIA',10,NULL,24,'24-Hour Checkout',' Village & Post: Khempur, Via: Mavli-313203,\r\n     District: Udaipur, \r\n     Rajasthan, INDIA','the-ravla-khempur--2','2013-07-20 16:50:57','2013-07-20 16:50:57',NULL,NULL),(178,'Taj Lake Palace ','Taj-Lake-Palace1.jpg','lake-palace-udaipur-b3.jpg','IMG_5145.JPG','4248052142_fd80a972ca_z.jpg','Yes, much of the resplendence of the Lake Palace Hotel has to do with the sheer fact that it is seemingly floating on Pichola Lake.

Located in the heart of Jaipur, this beautiful five-storey palace was constructed in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh who belonged to Kachhwaha Rajput dynasty. The main architect of this palace built of red and pink sandstone, is Lal Chand Ustad and the palace is believed to have been constructed in the form of the crown of Krishna, the Hindu god. Considered as an embodiment of Rajputana architecture, the main highlight of Hawa Mahal is its pyramid shape and its 953 windows or \'Jharokhas\' which are decorated with intricate designs. The main intention behind the construction of the Mahal was to facilitate the royal women and provide them a view of everyday life through the windows, as they never appeared in public.

Sawai Pratap Singh\'s devotion to Lord Krishna is evident in the palace\'s construction as it resembles the lord\'s crown. Though many reasons are cited behind the construction of the fort, Purdah system followed by the Rajputs is said to be one of the main causes. During those days, Rajput royal women did not appear in public or in front of strangers. However, they were keen to follow the day-to-day events and royal processions occurring on the streets. It is for their benefit that the Hawa Mahal was built, complete with small windows and screened balconies. This gave the women a sense of freedom, without appearing in public.','hawa-mahal',0,1,'634924054127102313_Hawa_Mahal__Jaipur__Rajasthan3.jpg','hawa-mahal.jpg','Hawamahal-08.jpg','Hawa-Mahal2.jpg','2013-07-07 14:11:38','2013-07-09 20:52:24'),(2,'Fatehpur Sikri',2,'https://maps.google.co.in/maps?q=Sikandra&hl=en&ll=27.178053,78.01471&spn=0.009735,0.021136&sll=27.179456,78.021341&sspn=0.009735,0.021136&hq=Sikandra&t=m&z=16','This magnificent fortified ghost city, 40km west of Agra, was the short-lived capital of the Mughal empire between 1571 and 1585, during the reign of Emperor Akbar. Akbar visited Sikri to consult the Sufi saint Shaikh Salim Chisti, who predicted the birth of an heir to the Mughal throne. When the prophecy came true, Akbar built his new capital here. Although a brilliant Indo-Islamic masterpiece, the city was erected in an area that suffered from water shortages and was abandoned shortly after Akbar’s death.

This ancient city bears many fine architectural monuments which bear testimony to a blend of Indian, Persian and Mughal architectural influences. The history of the origin of this city is quite interesting. Akbar had visited a saint known as Salim Chishti who then foretold that the emperor would have a second son who will survive to become a great ruler. The Sufi saint was then residing in a cavern near a ridge at Sikri. When in 1569 a second son was indeed born to Akbar, he decided to move his capital from Agra to Sikri in honor of the saint Salim. The son was also known as Prince Salim, who later grew up to become the great emperor Jehangir. The Mughal emperor then started the construction of an architectural wonder of a town, based on the influences of the Persian architecture which he had witnessed during the rule of his ancestor, Timur.

The construction of the Taj Mahal was entrusted to a board of architects under imperial supervision, including Abd ul-Karim Ma\'mur Khan, Makramat Khan, and Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.

Construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632. The court chronicles of Shah Jahan\'s grief illustrate the love story traditionally held as an inspiration for Taj Mahal. The principal mausoleum was completed in 1648 and the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later. Emperor Shah Jahan himself described the Taj in these words.','Soon after the Taj Mahal\'s completion, Shah Jahan was deposed by his son Aurangzeb and put under house arrest at nearby Agra Fort.

When Emperor Shah Jahan paraded out of the fort atop an elephant into the streets of Old Delhi, though, he and the fort that he built were a grandiose display of pomp and power. The walls of the fort extend for 2km and vary in height from 18m on the river side to 33m on the city side. Shah Jahan began construction of the massive fort in 1638 and it was completed in 1648. Shah Jahan never completely moved his capital from Agra to his new city of Shahjahanabad in Delhi because he was deposed and imprisoned in Agra Fort by his sly son Aurangzeb. The Red Fort dates from the very peak of Mughal power. The Mughal reign from Delhi was a short one, however; Aurangzeb was the first and last great Mughal emperor to rule from here. The 10m-deep moat, which has been bone-dry since 1857, was originally crossed on creaky wooden drawbridges, but these were replaced with stone bridges in 1811. Tickets to the fort are available from the ticket kiosk opposite Lahore Gate (the main gate). Since Independence, many landmark political speeches have taken place at the fort and every year on Independence Day (15 August) it hosts the prime minister\'s address to the nation. Each evening (except Monday) a one-hour sound-and-light show re-creates events of India\'s history, particularly those associated with the Red Fort.','The Red Fort derives its name from the extensive use of red sandstone on the massive walls that surround the fort. Shah Jahan commissioned the construction of the Red Fort in 1638 when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Ustad Ahmad and Ustad Hamid were chosen as the architects for construction of the royal palace. Construction began in the auspicious month of Muharram on 13 May 1638. Construction of the fort was supervised by Shah Jahan himself and was completed in 1648. The Red Fort was originally referred to as \"Qila-i-Mubarak\" (the blessed fort), because it was the residence of the royal family. Unlike the other Mughal forts, layout of the boundary walls of the Red Fort is not symmetrical so as to retain and integrate the older Salimgarh Fort. The fortress palace was an important focal point of the medieval city of Shahjahanabad (present day Old Delhi). The planning and aesthetics of the Red Fort represent the zenith of Mughal creativity which prevailed during the reign of emperor Shah Jahan. Aurangzeb, Shah Jahan\'s successor, added the Moti Masjid to the emperor\'s private quarters and constructed barbicans in front of the two main gates, which made the entrance route to the palace more circuitous.','red-fort-lal-qila',0,1,'Red__Fort.jpg','RedFort_001.jpg','Red-Fort-Delhi-Picture-3.jpg','red-fort-new-delhi.jpg','2013-07-07 19:42:19','2013-07-09 20:52:25'),(18,'Gurdwara Bangla Sahib',15,'https://maps.google.co.in/maps?q=Gurdwara+Bangla+Sahib&hl=en&ll=28.626419,77.208996&spn=0.076846,0.169086&sll=28.631993,77.206249&sspn=0.076842,0.169086&hq=Gurdwara+Bangla+Sahib&radius=15000&t=m&z=13','The Gurdwara Bangla Sahib is an important Sikh shrine and a constant hive of activity.

Its massive yellow sandstone walls are a tawny lion color during the day, fading to honey-gold as the sun sets, thereby camouflaging the fort in the yellow desert.

The mosque was the result of the efforts of over 6,000 workers, over a period of six years (1650–1656 AD). The cost of the construction in those times was 10 lakh (1 million) Rupees. Emperor Shahjahan also built the Taj Mahal, at Agra and the Red Fort in New Delhi, which stands opposite the Jama Masjid. The Jama Masjid was completed in 1656 AD (1066 AH), with three great gates, four towers and two 40 m-high minarets constructed of strips of red sandstone and white marble. About 25,000 people can pray here at a time. The mosque has a vast paved rectangular courtyard, which is nearly 75 m by 66 m. Shah Jahan built several important mosques in Delhi, Agra, Ajmer and Lahore. The Jama Masjid\'s floor plan is very similar to the Jama Masjid, Fatehpur Sikri near Agra, but the Jama Masjid in Delhi is bigger and more imposing of the two. Its Badshahi Mosque of Lahore built by Shah Jahan\'s son Aurangzeb in 1673 is closely related to the Jama Masjid at Raipur.

Maharawal Beri Sal commissioned the construction of this Haveli. The architects of this haveli were Hathi and Lulu who happened to be brothers. There is a very interesting story regarding its construction. It is said that the two brothers started building different facets of haveli simultaneously. In those days there were no such instruments, which could keep a track on continuity and thus when this building came up finally it had irregular shape. Barring that, this haveli is still considered the best in Jaisalmer in terms of grandeur. There are other minute details worth appreciation. For example there are two Elephants made of yellow stone. These life-size replicas have been put in front of the main entrance so that it looks as if they are guarding the Haveli. Other than these, there are pictures engraved on pillars and walls. These consist of Horses, Cattle, and depiction of Flora among other things. But the most interesting aspect of this haveli is the drawing of modern amenities such as cars, fans etc. It is said and believed that the Architect brothers dint see these things ever in their life and engraved it with mere help of their descriptions given by people who had seen it. Thus the architecture present in this haveli is quite different from the one popular in other parts of Jaisalmer. The workmanship of Jaisalmer havelis is an amalgam of both Rajput architecture as well as Islamic art that was imported via the traders\' caravan through the desert.','This is probably the last of the big family haveli to be so decorated. It was constructed in the mid of 19th century, but it is in many ways the most beautiful examples of the subtly of the stone carver’s art. There is delicacy in the finish of the work which at times, as around the tiny little arched windows become pure magic. Nothing at Fatehpur Sikri and not even the famous white marble pierced screen in the Taj can compare in lightness with the exquisite work here. One feels one could pick it up and crush it like a handful of cake.\r\nThe remarkable fact about Nathmal is that it was carved by two brothers Hati and Laloo (The Silawats or stone carvers were all muslims and these families migrated to Pakistan in 1947). They were famous carvers in Jaisalmer State. Each undertook to work on one entire side i.e. the left side by one and right by the other. Moreover not a single motif used by one is repeated exactly by the other.

There is a plaque fixed on one of the structures in the Jantar Mantar observatory in New Delhi that was placed there in 1910 mistakenly dating the construction of the complex to the year 1710. Later research, though, suggests 1724 as the actual year of construction. The primary purpose of the observatory was to compile astronomical tables, and to predict the times and movements of the sun, moon and planets.

From inside the Ram, an observer could align the position of a star with various markings or a window\'s edge.

Eventually he took refuge with the Safavid shah of Persia, who helped him regain Delhi in 1555, the year before his death. Humayun\'s Persian wife, Hamida Begum, supervised the construction from 1562-1572 of her husband\'s tomb in Delhi. The architect, Mirak Mirza Ghiyuath, was Persian and had previously designed buildings in Herat (now northwest Afghanistan), Bukhara (now Uzbekistan), and elsewhere in India. The location chosen for the building on the bank of the Yamuna river adjoins the shrine of an important Sufi Chistiyya order saint, Nizam al-Din Awliya. The Chistiyya was particularly venerated by the Mughals; Humayun\'s son, Akbar, would build his new palace at Fatehpur Sikri next to the shrine of another saint of the Chistiyya order. The tomb established some of the important norms for later Mughal mausolea. It is set in a geometrically arranged garden criscrossed by numerous water channels and probably representing symbolically a paradise setting. Such typical Persian gardens had been introduced into India by Babur; later they would be found in the Red Fort in Delhi and at the Taj Mahal in Agra. ','It was built in 1565 A.D. nine years after the death of Humayun, by his senior widow Bega Begam. Inside the walled enclosure the most notable features are the garden squares (chaharbagh) with pathways water channels, centrally located well proportional mausoleum topped by double dome.

It is named as \"Jagat Mandir\" in honour of the last named Maharana Jagat Singh. The royal family used the palace as a summer resort and pleasure palace for holding parties. The palace served as a refuge to asylum seekers on two separate occasions.','Jag Mandir\'s history begins with the Maharana Karan Singh\'s benevolence shown to Emperor Shahjahan (1605–1627). Shahjahan, before he was crowned as Mughal Emperor, was known during his young days as Prince Khurram. As Khurram, he rebelled against his father Emperor Jahangir in 1623, because he wanted to be the heir to the Mughal throne. Faced with danger of getting thwarted in his campaign, he sought refuge in Mewar Kingdom at Udaipur where he was given safe haven by the then Maharana Karan Singh (it is said that this courtesy was extended because Khurram\'s mother was a Rajput Hindu lady). He was initially kept in the City Palace along with his wife Mumtaz Mahal and his two sons, Prince Dara and Prince Aurangzeb.

In the 8th century, the capital was moved to Chittor, a hill top fort from where the Sisodias ruled for 80 years. Maharana Udai Singh II inherited the Mewar kingdom at Chittor in 1537 but by that time there were signs of losing control of the fort in wars with the Mughals. Udai Singh II, therefore, chose the site near Lake Pichola for his new kingdom because the location was well protected on all sides by forests, lakes and the Aravalli hills. He had chosen this site for his new capital, much before the sacking of Chittor by Emperor Akbar, on the advice of a hermit he had met during one of his hunting expeditions.\r\nRoyal Angan the first structure built by Maharana Udai Singh\r\nAt his capital Chittor, Maharana Udai Singh soon faced defeat at the hands of Mughal Emperor Akbar. He soon moved to Udaipur to the chosen location to establish his new capital.

Each time the men fought bravely rushing out of the fort walls charging the enemy but lost every time. Following these defeats, Jauhar was committed thrice by more than 13,000 ladies and children of the Rajput heroes who laid their lives in battles at Chittorgarh Fort, first led by Rani Padmini wife of Rana Rattan Singh who was killed in the battle in 1303, and later by Rani Karnavati in 1537 AD. Thus, the fort represents the quintessence of tribute to the nationalism, courage, medieval chivalry and sacrifice exhibited by the Mewar rulers of Sisodia and their kinsmen and women and children, between the 7th and 16th centuries. The rulers, their soldiers, the women folk of royalty and the commoners considered death as a better option than dishonor in the face of surrender to the foreign invading armies.','Chittorgarh Fort is considered to be the largest fort of India in terms of area.

It is also said that the fort was gifted to Bappa Rawal as part of Solanki princess’s dowry in the 8th century.The fort was looted and destroyed at the hands of Emperor Akbar in 1568 AD and subsequently never resettled but only refurbished in 1905 AD. Three important battles were fought for control of the fort; in 1303, Ala-ud-din Khilji besieged the fort; in 1535, Sultan of Gujarat Bahadur Shah besieged the fort; and in 1568, Mughal Emperor Akbar attacked the fort.Not that there were only defeats at the fort. Excluding the periods of siege, the fort had always remained in possession of the Sisodias of the Guhilot (or Gehlot/Guhila) clan of Rajputs, who descended from Bappa Rawal.

The Jain inscriptions at Mathura from the Kushana period (1st to 3rd centuries) mention a \"Majjhimilla\" branch of the \"Kottiya\" gana, indicating that it was a major Jain centre. The famous Acharya Haribhadra Suri (6th century) was born in Chittor and wrote \"Dhurtopakhyana\" there. There was a scholar Elacharya at Chittor from whom Vira-senacharya (9th century) learned the ancient Shat-khandagama and Kashayapahuda. Vira-senacharya later the famous \"Dhavala\" and \"Jayadhavala\" on the basis of these books. It was the residence of Jinavallabha who propagated the Vidhimarga in the 12th century.

It is located in the southern part of the fort. Chhatris (pavilions) crown the palace roofs and a water moat surrounds the palace. This style of palace became the forerunner of other palaces built in the state with the concept of Jal Mahal (palace surrounded by water). It is at this Palace where Alauddin was permitted to glimpse at the mirror image of Rani Padmini, wife of Maharana Rattan Singh. It is widely believed that this glimpse of Padmini\'s beauty besotted him and convinced him to destroy Chittor in order to possess her. Maharana Rattan Singh was killed and Rani Padmini committed Jauhar. Rani Padmini\'s beauty is compared to that of Cleopatra and her life story is an eternal legend in the history of Chittor, in particular and of the Mewar state in general. The bronze gates to this pavilion were removed and transported to Agra by Akbar.','In 1303 Allauddin khilji, Sultan of Delhi, intrigued by tales of the matchless beauty of Padmini, Rani of Chittor, of her wit and charm, decided to verify this himself. His armies surrounded Chittor, and the sultan sent a message to Rana Rattan Singh, Padmini\'s husband, to say that he would spare the city if he could meet its famous queen. The compromise finally reached was that the sultan could look upon Padmini\'s reflection if he came unarmed into the fort. Accordingly, the sultan went up the hill and glimpsed a reflection of the beautiful Padmini standing by a lotus pool. He thanked his host who courteously escorted Allauddin down to the outer gate-where the sultan\'s men waited in ambush to take the rana hostage.There was consternation in Chittor until Padmini devised a plan. A messenger informed the sultan that the rani would come to him. Dozens of curtained palanquins set off down the hill, each carried by six humble bearers. Once inside the Sultan\'s camp, four well-armed Rajput warriors leaped out of each palanquin and each lowly palanquin bearer drew a sword.In the ensuing battle, Rana Rattan Singh was rescued-but 7,000 Rajput warriors died. The sultan now attacked Chittor with renewed vigor. Having lost 7,000 of its best warriors, Chittor could not hold out. Surrender was unthinkable. The rani and her entire entourage of women, the wives of generals and soldiers, sent their children into hiding with loyal retainers. They then dressed their wedding fine , slid their farewells, and singing ancient hymns, boldly entered the mahal and performed jauhar.','padmini-palace',0,1,'634923916862773221_Padmini_Palace__Chittorgarh__Rajasthan.jpg','Oil_painting_of_Padmini_s_palace_in_the_fort_in_the_midst_of_the_tank.jpg','DSCN3843.JPG','DSCF1448.JPG','2013-07-07 21:01:59','2013-07-09 21:55:50'),(82,'Dargah Of Khwaja Muin-Ud-Din Chishti',12,'<iframe width=\"425\" height=\"350\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"https://maps.google.co.in/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Dargah+Of+Khwaja+Moinuddin+Chishti,+Rajasthan&amp;aq=&amp;sll=24.879346,74','Moinuddin Chishti Also known as Gharib Nawaz \"Benefactor of the Poor\"  he is the most famous Sufi saint of the Chishti Order of the Indian Subcontinent.

The fort was originally called Chintamani and was renamed Junagarh or \"Old Fort\" in the early 20th century when the ruling family moved to Lalgarh Palace outside the fort limits. It is one of the few major forts in Rajasthan which is not built on a hilltop. The modern city of Bikaner has developed around the fort.The fort complex was built under the supervision of Karan Chand, the Prime Minister of Raja Rai Singh, the sixth ruler of Bikaner, who ruled from 1571 to 1611 AD. Construction of the walls and associated moat commenced in 1589 and was completed in 1594. It was built outside the original fort of the city, about 1.5 km from the city centre. Some remnants of the old fort are preserved near the Lakshmi Narayan temple.Historical records reveal that despite the repeated attacks by enemies to capture the fort, it was not taken, except for a lone one-day occupation by Kamran Mirza. Kamran was the second son of the Mughal Emperor Babur who attacked Bikaner in 1534, which was then ruled by Rao Jait Singh. In the battle, the Mughals were defeated by Rathors. Kamran then returned to Lahore.The 5.28 hectares large fort precinct is studded with palaces, temples and pavilions.These buildings depict a composite culture, manifest in the mix of architectural styles.','Before the present Junagarh Fort was built, an old stone fort existed in the city. This fort was built in 1478 by Rao Bika who established the city of Bikaner in 1472. Rao Bika was the second son of Maharaja Rao Jodha of the Rathor clan, the founder of Jodhpur city. He conquered the large arid lands to the northern region of Rajasthan to set up his domain. As the second son of Jodha he had no chance of inheriting his father’s territory of Jodhpur or to the title of Maharaja. He, therefore, reconciled and decided to build his own kingdom at Bikaner at the place then called \"Jungladesh\". Bikaner, though a partly of the Thar Desert, was considered an oasis on the trade route between Central Asia and the Gujarat coast since it had adequate spring water sources. Bika’s name was thus tagged to the Bikaner city as well as to the then state of Bikaner (“the settlement of Bika”) that he established. The history of Bikaner and the fort within it thus start with Bika.It was only about 100 years later that Bikaner’s fortunes flourished under Raja Rai Singhji, the sixth ruler of Bikaner, who ruled from 1571 to 1611. During the Mughal Empire’s rule in the country, he accepted the suzerainty of the Mughals and held a high position of an army general in the court of Emperor Akbar and his son Emperor Jahangir. His successful war exploits by way of winning half of Mewar kingdom won him accolades and rewards from the Mughal emperors. He was gifted the jagirs (lands) of Gujarat and Burhanpur. With the large revenue earned from these jagirs, he built the Junagarh fort on a plain land, which has an average elevation of 760 feet. The formal foundation ceremony for the fort was held on 17 February 1589 and the fort was completed on 17 January 1594.Raja Rai Singhji, was an expert in arts and architecture and the knowledge that he acquired during his several sojourns to several countries are amply reflected in the numerous monuments he built in the Junagarh fort.Thus the fort, a composite structure, became an outstanding example of architecture and a unique centre of art, amidst the Thar desert.','junagarh-fort',0,1,'6849585964_6ae59c2b61_h.jpg','Junagarh_Fort_Bikaner.jpg','junagarh-fort-4.jpg','bikaner.jpg','2013-07-07 23:00:35','2013-07-09 20:52:27'),(95,'Jain Temples',14,'https://maps.google.co.in/maps?q=jain+temples+near+Bikaner,+Rajasthan&hl=en&sll=27.084499,75.715184&sspn=0.623568,1.352692&oq=Jain+Temples+bik&hq=jain+temples&hnear=Bikaner,+Rajasthan&t=m&z=15','This temple is oldest existing structure in Bikaner.

She was the daughter of the Portuguese Viceroy of Jaffnapatnam, in Sri Lanka. She and her family arrived in Goa in 1644 and she married a Fidalgo from Spain in 1656. Her husband was Dom Antonio Souto Maior. They were an extremely affluent family, and the entire property from the present day Cabo Raj Nivas all the way to Caranzalem belonged to the Souto Maiors. She died on December 16, 1682.\r\nDona Paula was a woman of charity and is known to have helped the villagers and worked a lot for their betterment, so after her death, the villagers decided to re-name the village as Dona Paula. Initially the village was called Oddavell. The Cabo Raj Bhavan is situated at a scenic spot of Dona Paula. It is also home of a historic British war-graves cemetery.

The nawabs were responsible for turning Lucknow into a flourishing centre for the arts, but their empire came to a dramatic end when the British East India Company deposed the last nawab, triggering the Uprising of 1857. Agra was later merged with Avadh and the state became known as United Province. It was renamed Uttar Pradesh after Independence and has since been the most dominant state in Indian politics, producing half of the country’s prime ministers. However, the people of the state have not benefited much from this as poor governance, a high birth rate, a low literacy rate and an erratic electricity supply have held back economic progress in the past 60 years. In 2000, the mountainous northwestern part of the state was carved off to create the new state of Uttaranchal.\r\n','uttar-prdesh',1,0,'lucknow_11.jpg','sarnath-uttar-pradesh.jpg','varanasi-india.jpg','uttar-pradesh-tourist-attractions-2-chotta-imambara.jpg','2013-07-07 08:07:23','2013-07-09 06:38:49'),(3,'KA','Karnataka',1,'https://maps.google.co.in/maps?q=Karnataka&hl=en&sll=27.994401,80.090332&sspn=9.886051,21.643066&hnear=Karnataka&t=m&z=6&iwloc=A','If you’re looking for variety in your Indian travel experience, Karnataka fits the bill nicely.

Dynasties such as the Cholas and Gangas played important roles in the region’s history, but it was the Hoysalas (11th to 14th centuries), who have left a lasting mark with their architecturally stunning temples at Somnathpur, Halebid and Belur. In 1327, Mohammed Tughlaq’s Muslim army sacked the Hoysala capital at Halebid, but in 1346 the Hindu empire of Vijayanagar annexed it. This dynasty, with its capital at Hampi, peaked in the early 1550s, then fell in 1565 to the Deccan sultanates.

The magnificent scenic beauty and the architectural splendours of its temples, churches and old houses have made Goa a firm favorite with travelers around the world. But then, Goa is much more than just beaches and sea. It has a soul which goes deep into unique history, rich culture and some of the prettiest natural scenery that India has to offer. Much of the real Goa is in its interiors, both inside its buildings and in the hinterland away from the coastal area.Legends from Hindu mythology credit Lord Parshuram, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu with the creation of Goa. Over the centuries various dynasties have ruled Goa. Rashtrakutas, Kadambas, Silaharas, Chalukyas, Bahamani Muslims and most famously the Portuguese have been rulers of Goa. Goa was liberated by the Indian Army from Portuguese colonisation on December 19, 1961 and became an Union Territory along with the enclaves of Daman and Diu. On May 30, 1987 Goa was conferred statehood and became the 25th state of the Indian Republic. Having been the meeting point of races, religions and cultures of East and West over the centuries, Goa has a multi-hued and distinctive lifestyle quite different from the rest of India. Hindu and Catholic communities make up almost the entire population with minority representation of Muslims and other religions.\r\n','In the 3rd century BC Goa formed part of the Mauryan empire. Later it was ruled by the Satavahanas of Kolhapur and eventually passed to the Chalukyas of Badami from AD 580 to 750.\r\nGoa fell to the Muslims for the first time in 1312, but they weren’t fans of the beach and eventually left in 1370 under the forceful persuasion of Harihara I of the Vijayanagar mpire. During the next 100 years Goa’s harbours were important landing places for ships carrying Arabian horses for the Vijayanagar cavalry.\r\nBlessed as it is by natural harbours and wide rivers, Goa was the ideal base for the seafaring Portuguese, who arrived in 1510 aiming to control the spice route from the East. Jesuit missionaries led by St Francis Xavier arrived in 1542. For a while, Portuguese control was limited to a small area around Old Goa, but by the middle of the 16th century it had expanded to include the provinces of Bardez and Salcete.\r\nThe Marathas (the central Indian people who controlled much of India at various points in time) almost vanquished the Portuguese in the late 18th century, and there was a brief occupation by the British during the Napoleonic Wars in Europe. However, it was not until 1961, when the Indian army marched into Goa, that Portuguese occupation finally came to its end on the subcontinent.\r\nIn 1967, a Goan opinion poll showed that the state\'s residents didn\'t want to be assimilated into its neighbouring state Marharashtra, despite Maharashtra pushing for it. But it wasn\'t until 1987 that Goa was officially declared India\'s 25th state by Prime Minister Rajiv Ghandhi, in a landmark ruling for the state\'s generations of armed supporters. Five years later, Goa\'s local language, Konkani, was recognised as one of India\'s 22 official regional languages.\r\nToday, Goa has one of India’s highest per-capita incomes, with farming, fishing, tourism and iron-ore mining forming the basis of its economy.','goa',1,1,'beach-goa-india.jpeg','goa.jpg','goaattractions9.jpg','Goa_tour_package_1.jpg','2013-06-29 19:07:25','2013-07-09 06:40:56'),(8,'CJ','Gujarat',1,'https://maps.google.co.in/maps?q=gujarat&hl=en&sll=22.296567,70.802076&sspn=0.010979,0.021136&hnear=Gujarat&t=m&z=7&iwloc=A','Aavo Padharo, words of welcome in the language of Gujarat because it is here that these words ring truely and the guest is \'God\' and the people of Gujarat are gregariously friendly, inviting and will entice you to come again and again.\r\n\r\nHere in Gujarat you will discover centuries of history as spanning the geological core of the earth onto a fascinatingly vibrant future.

Pushyagupta, a Vaishya, was appointed Governor of Saurashtra by the Mauryan regime. He ruled (322 BC to 294 BC) Giringer (present Junagadh) and built a dam on the Sudarshan lake. Emperor Ashoka, the grandson of Chandragupta Maurya, not only ordered engraving of his famous edicts on the rock at Junagadh, but asked his Governor Tusherpha to take out canals from the lake where an earlier Mauryan Governor had built a dam. Between the decline of the Mauryan power and Saurashtra coming under the sway of Samprati Mauryas of Ujjain, there was a Greek incursion into Gujarat led by Demetrius.\r\nFor nearly 300 years from the start of the 1st century AD, Saka rulers played prominent part in Gujarat\'s history. Weather beaten rock at Junagadh gives a glimpse of the Ruler Rudradaman I (100 AD) of the Saka satraps known as Western Satraps, or Kshatraps. Mahakshatrap Rudradaman I founded the Kardamaka dynasty which ruled from Anupa on the banks of the Narmada up to Aparanta region which bordered Punjab. In Gujarat several battles were fought between the south Indian Satavahana dynasty and the Western Satraps.

Located south of the eastern Himalayas, Assam comprises the Brahmaputra and the Barak river valleys along with the Karbi Anglong and the North Cachar Hills with an area of 30,285 square miles (78,438 km²).  Assam is surrounded by six of the other Seven Sister States: Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura and Meghalaya. These states are connected to the rest of India via a narrow strip in West Bengal called the Siliguri Corridor or \"Chicken\'s Neck\". \r\nAssam also shares international borders with Bhutan and Bangladesh; and cultures, peoples and climate with South-East Asia – important elements in India’s Look East policy.  Assam became a part of the British India after the British occupied the region following the First Anglo-Burmese War of 1824–1826. It is known for Assam tea, large and old petroleum resources, Assam silk and for its rich biodiversity. Assam has successfully conserved the one-horned Indian rhinoceros from near extinction, along with the tiger and numerous species of birds, and it provides one of the last wild habitats for the Asian elephant. \r\n','Assam state and adjoining regions have evidences of human settlements from all the periods of the Stone ages, but there are no archeological evidence of bronze- or iron-age culture. The hills at the height of 1,500–2,000 feet (460 to 615 m) were popular habitats probably due to availability of exposed doleritic basalt useful for tool-making.\r\nAccording to the Kalika Purana (c.7th–8th AD), written in Assam, the earliest ruler of Assam was Mahiranga Danav followed by Hatak, Sambar, Ratna and Ghatak; Naraka removed this line of rulers and established his own Naraka dynasty. It mentions that the last of the Naraka-bhauma rulers, Narak, was slain by Krishna. Naraka\'s son Bhagadatta, mentioned in the Mahabharata, fought for the Kauravas in the battle of Kurukshetra with an army of kiratas, chinas and dwellers of the eastern coast. Later rulers of Kamarupa frequently drew their lineage from the Naraka rulers. However, there is much evidence that Mahayana Buddhism was prominent in ancient Assam. After Hi-uen Shang\'s visit Mahayana Buddhism came to Assam. Relics of Tezpur, Malini Than, Kamakhya and Madan Kam Dev Temple are the evidences of Mahayana Buddhism.\r\n','assam',1,1,'59648611.jpg','nam.jpg','river-cruise-assam-tourist-spots.jpg','sights.jpg','2013-06-29 19:07:25','2013-07-15 16:13:55'),(24,'SK','Sikkim',1,'','','','sikkim',0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2013-06-29 19:07:25','2013-07-08 18:59:19'),(25,'TN','Tamil Nadu',1,'https://maps.google.co.in/maps?q=Tamil+Nadu&hl=en&sll=30.066753,79.0193&sspn=4.84802,10.821533&hnear=Tamil+Nadu&t=m&z=6','Tamil Nadu literally \"Tamil Country\") is one of the 28 states of India.

Except for relatively short periods in its history, the Tamil region has remained independent of external occupation. The three ancient Tamil empires of Chera, Chola,and Pandya were of ancient origins. Together they ruled over this land with a unique culture and language, contributing to the growth of some of the oldest extant literature in the world. They had extensive maritime trade contacts with the Roman empire. These four dynasties were in constant struggle with each other vying for hegemony over the land. Invasion by the Kalabhras during the 3rd century disturbed the traditional order of the land by displacing the three ruling kingdoms. These occupiers were overthrown by the resurgence of the Pandyas and the Pallavas, who restored the traditional kingdoms.\r\n','tamil-nadu',0,1,'15987056-catholic-church-at-an-intersection-in-the-center-of-madurai-tamil-nadu-india-on-september-2-2008.jpg','2697988658642e5e7e2o.jpg','Brihadeeswarar_Temple__Thanjavur__Tamil_Nadu.jpg','Murugan_Temple__Palani__Tamil_Nadu3.jpg','2013-06-29 19:07:25','2013-07-09 06:46:18'),(26,'TR','Tripura',1,'','','','tripura',0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2013-06-29 19:07:25','2013-07-08 18:58:49'),(27,'UT','Uttarakhand',1,'https://maps.google.co.in/maps?q=Uttarakhand+&hl=en&sll=19.746024,75.717773&sspn=10.534177,21.643066&hnear=Uttarakhand&t=m&z=7','Uttarakhand - the land of gods, the home of Himalayas and truly a paradise on earth, allures everyone from everywhere.

As the cradle of the Indian Renaissance and national freedom movement, erstwhile Bengal has long been considered the country’s cultural heartland, famous for its eminent writers, poets, artists, spiritualists and revolutionaries. Overshadowed perhaps by the reputation of its capital Kolkata (Calcutta), it is nonetheless surprising that this rich and diverse state receives so few foreign tourists. In the World Heritage–listed Sunderbans, the Ganges delta hosts not only the world’s most extensive mangrove forest, but also the greatest population of the elusive Royal Bengal tiger.

It was part of the Mauryan empire in the 3rd century BC before being overrun by the Guptas. For three centuries from around the 9th century AD, the Pala dynasty controlled a large area based in Bengal and including parts of Orissa, Bihar. Following the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, Bengal became an independent Muslim state. The British established a trading post in Kolkata in 1698, which quickly prospered. Sensing rich pickings, Siraj-ud-daula, the nawab of Bengal, came down from his capital at Murshidabad and easily took Kolkata in 1756. Robert Clive defeated him the following year at the Battle of Plassey, helped by the treachery of Siraj-ud-daula’s uncle, Mir Jafar, who commanded the greater part of the nawab’s army. He was rewarded by succeeding his nephew as nawab, but after the Battle of Buxar in 1764 the British took full control of Bengal. In 1947 Indian independence from Britain and the subsequent partition of the country saw the state of Bengal divided on religious grounds, causing the upheaval of millions of Bengalis.\r\n','west-bengal',1,1,'Victoria_Memorial__Kolkata__West_Bengal3333.jpg','image_gallery.jpg','howrah-bridge.jpg','Birla_Temple__Kolkata__West_Bengal.jpg','2013-06-29 19:07:25','2013-07-15 15:24:23'),(30,'AN','Andaman & Nicobar',1,'','','','andaman-nicobar',0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2013-06-29 19:07:25','2013-07-08 18:55:39'),(31,'CH','Chandigarh',1,'https://maps.google.co.in/maps?q=Chandigarh&hl=en&sll=11.127122,78.656894&sspn=10.978905,21.643066&hnear=Chandigarh&t=m&z=12','Chandigarh is a city and union territory in India that serves as the capital of two states, Haryana and Punjab. The name Chandigarh translates as \"The Fort of Chandi\". The name is derived from an ancient temple called Chandi Mandir, devoted to the Hindu goddess Chandi, near the city.[4] The city of Chandigarh was the first planned city in India post independence in 1947 (pre-independence planned cities include Dispur in Assam, New Delhi in Delhi, Jaipur in Rajasthan, etc.) and is known internationally for its architecture and urban design.[5] The city has projects designed by architects such as Le Corbusier, Pierre Jeanneret, Jane Drew, and Maxwell Fry. The city tops the list of Indian States and Union Territories with the highest per capita income in the country at Rs.99,262 at current prices and Rs.70,361 at constant prices (2006–2007).[6] The city was reported in 2010 to be the \"cleanest\" in India, based on a national government study,[7] and the territory also headed the list of Indian states and territories according to research conducted using 2005 data by Human Development Index.\r\n','After the Partition of India in 1947, the former British province of Punjab was also split between east Punjab in India and west Punjab in Pakistany. The Indian Punjab required a new capital city to replace Lahore, which became part of Pakistan during the partition.[9] After several plans to make additions to existing cities were found to be unfeasible for various reasons, the decision to construct a new and planned city was undertaken. Of all the new town schemes in independent India, the Chandigarh project quickly assumed prime significance, because of the city\'s strategic location as well as the personal interest of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of independent India. Commissioned by Nehru to reflect the new nation\'s modern, progressive outlook, Chandigarh was designed by the French (born Swiss) architect and urban planner, Le Corbusier, in the 1950s. Le Corbusier was in fact the second architect of the city, after the initial master plan was prepared by the American architect-planner Albert Mayer who was working with the Polish-born architect Matthew Nowicki.[citation needed] Chandigarh hosts the largest of Le Corbusier\'s many Open Hand sculptures, standing 26 meters high. The Open Hand (La Main Ouverte) is a recurring motif in Le Corbusier\'s architecture, a sign for him of \"peace and reconciliation. It is open to give and open to receive.\" It represents the give and take of ideas.[10] On 1 November 1966, the newly formed Indian state of Haryana was carved out of the eastern portion of the Punjab, in order to create Haryana as a majority Hindi-speaking people, while the western portion of Punjab retained a mostly Punjabi language-speaking majority and remained as the current federated state of Punjab. However, the city of Chandigarh was on the border, and was thus created into a union territory to serve as capital of both these states.\r\n','chandigarh',0,1,'1461710-One_of_the_magnificent_vistas_in_the_Rock_Garden-Chandigarh.jpg','634903983320651071_chandigarh_big.jpg','chandigarh.jpg','pinjore_garden_chandigarh.jpg','2013-06-29 19:07:25','2013-07-09 06:47:10'),(32,'DN','Dadra and Nagar Haveli',1,'','','','dadra-and-nagar-haveli',0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2013-06-29 19:07:25','2013-07-08 18:54:59'),(33,'DD','Daman & Diu',1,'','','','daman-diu',0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2013-06-29 19:07:25','2013-07-08 18:54:38'),(34,'DL','Delhi',1,'https://maps.google.co.in/maps?q=Delhi&hl=en&sll=12.953997,77.63094&sspn=0.740097,1.352692&hnear=New+Delhi,+West+Delhi,+Delhi&t=m&z=10','Delhi is a city that bridges two diverse worlds.

In disparity, the imperial city of New Delhi created by the British Raj is composed of spacious, tree-lined avenues and impressive government buildings. Delhi has been the seat of power for several rulers and many empires for about a millennium. Many a times the city was built, destroyed and then rebuilt here. fascinatingly, a number of Delhi\'s rulers played a dual role, first as destroyers and then as creators. Delhi has been the political hub of India. Every political activity in the country traces its roots here. This was true even of the legendary era. The Pandavas of the Mahabharata had their capital at Indraprastha, which is believed to have been geographically located in today\'s Delhi.\r\n','The history of the city is as old as the epic Mahabharata. The town was known as Indraprastha, where Pandavas used to live. In due course eight more cities came alive adjacent to Indraprastha: Lal Kot, Siri, Dinpanah, Quila Rai Pithora, Ferozabad, Jahanpanah, Tughlakabad and Shahjahanabad. Delhi has been a spectator to the political turmoil for over five centuries. It was ruled by the Mughals in progression to Khiljis and Tughlaqs. In 1192 the legions of the Afghan warrior Muhammad of Ghori captured the Rajput town, and the Delhi Sultanate was established (1206). The invasion of Delhi by Timur in 1398 put an end to the sultanate; the Lodis, last of the Delhi sultans, gave way to Babur, who, after the battle of Panipat in 1526, founded the Mughal Empire. The early Mughal emperors privileged Agra as their capital, and Delhi became their permanent seat only after Shah Jahan built (1638) the walls of Old Delhi.\r\n','delhi',1,1,'delhi1.jpg','india_gate_new_delhi.jpg','india-scenery-352-2.jpg','red.jpg','2013-06-29 19:07:25','2013-07-08 22:57:29'),(35,'LD','Lakshadweep',1,'','','','lakshadweep',0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2013-06-29 19:07:25','2013-07-08 18:54:21'),(36,'PY','Puducherry',1,'','','','puducherry',0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2013-06-29 19:07:25','2013-07-08 18:52:11');

It entails more than basic facts (education, work, relationships, and death) - a biography also portrays a subject\'s experience of these events. Unlike a profile or curriculum vitae (résumé), a biography presents a subject\'s life story, highlighting various aspects of his or her life, including intimate details of experience, and may include an analysis of the subject\'s personality.\r\nBiographical works are usually non-fiction, but fiction can also be used to portray a person\'s life. One in-depth form of biographical coverage is called legacy writing. Works in diverse media — from literature to film — form the genre known as biography.\r\nAn authorized biography is written with the permission, cooperation, and at times, participation of a subject or a subject\'s heirs. An autobiography is written by the person themselves, sometimes with the assistance of a collaborator or ghostwriter.[1]',1,1,NULL,NULL,'2013-07-27 22:46:03',4,'2013-07-27 22:46:03','2013-07-27 12:48:59','127.0.0.1','127.0.0.1','2013-07-18 09:43:20','2013-07-27 22:46:03');
